/**
 * The claim that justifies putting the turn pattern into the build.
 *
 * A pattern could have been applied to the finished sequence, the way the
 * Actions panel already does. It goes into the search instead, and this is why:
 * the search picks the letters, and some letters cannot honour a pattern. Type 6
 * is the static family — lowercase alpha, beta and gamma, in which neither hand
 * travels anywhere. Give one of those no turns either and the step is a step in
 * which nothing at all happens. The search has to see the pattern while it is
 * still choosing, so it can choose something else.
