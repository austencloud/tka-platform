/**
 * Asking the real builder to use a turn pattern.
 *
 * The point being proved here is about length. Turn allocation has always been
 * eager and sized to the word, but the search inserts bridge steps between
 * letters that have no direct transition, so the finished sequence is longer
 * than the word and its trailing steps come back with no turns at all. A
 * pattern is a period rather than an array: it is read modulo its own length,
 * so it has an answer at every index that will ever exist.
