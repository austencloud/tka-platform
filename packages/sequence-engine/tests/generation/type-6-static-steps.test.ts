/**
 * Static (Type 6) steps under an explicit turn pattern.
 *
 * α, β and γ are static: neither hand moves, and prop rotation is the whole
 * point of them. The generator used to refuse them everywhere except a start
 * position, so a user who asked for a specific figure of turns could never get
 * one built. Now they are offered whenever the caller asked for particular
 * turns — a turn pattern or a layer target — and Type6Constraint decides step
 * by step whether the step in front of it actually carries any.
 *
 * The two things worth guarding are the two ways this can go wrong: a static
 * step showing up with no turns (which reads as standing still), and static
 * steps leaking into ordinary undirected generation (which is what the old
 * blanket exclusion was protecting against).
