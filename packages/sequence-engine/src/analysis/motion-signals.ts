/**
 * Motion signals — the two independent directional signals a motion carries.
 *
 * TKA ground truth (MCP `get_term_definition`, verified 2026-07-05):
 *   - **pro** = the prop rotates in the same direction as the hand's arc;
 *     **anti** = opposite. Pro/anti is a *relation* between prop rotation and
 *     hand arc, not a raw spin direction.
 *   - A **reversal** flips when either signal flips: hand reversal (hand
 *     retraces, prop continues), prop reversal (hand continues, prop reverses),
 *     full reversal (both retrace). All three are reversals.
 *
 * Canonical data proof that `rotationDirection` records the PROP's spin, not
 * the hand's arc: letters A (pro) and B (anti) share the same blue hand path
 * w→n (a clockwise arc), but A stores rotationDirection "cw" while B stores
 * "ccw". So detecting reversals from `rotationDirection` alone is blind to
 * hand reversals — the hand-arc signal below closes that gap.
 *
 * Hand-arc computation (hybrid, in priority order):
 *   1. Authored `handPath` when present. The app stores it explicitly because
 *      it is "essential for floats (no rotation to derive from)" and it is the
 *      only signal that survives skewed motions that travel the long way
 *      around the grid (endpoint geometry cannot see `skewSteps`).
 *   2. Endpoint geometry on the 8-point location circle (shortest arc), the
 *      same convention as `HAND_ROTATION_DIRECTION_MAP`
 *      (src/loop/position-maps/circular-position-maps.ts) and the app's
 *      `deriveHandPath` / `calculateRotationDirection` helpers. Static
 *      (0 steps) and dash (4 steps, direction-ambiguous) have no arc.
 *
 * Orientation delta was rejected as a source: start/end orientation describe
 * the PROP's center-relative orientation and are subject to turn-parity rules
 * (even turns preserve, odd reverse — MCP pro definition), so they do not
 * encode the hand's travel direction.
