/**
 * Sequence Engine Types - Shared domain models
 *
 * Platform-agnostic types for sequence generation.
 *
 * Post-unification (Phase 1 complete):
 *   - Canonical `Step` and `Motion` live in `@tka/tka-types`.
 *   - `SequenceStep` and `MotionData` are transitional aliases pointing at
 *     `Step` and `Motion`. Engine internals use `Step`/`Motion` directly;
 *     app code still imports via the legacy names while Phase 2 migrates
 *     the app layer. After Phase 2 the aliases can be removed.
 *   - Legacy enum type aliases (MotionType, RotationDirection, Orientation,
 *     GridLocation, LetterCategory, LetterType, PositionGroup) remain as
 *     loose string literal unions so existing string-flavored engine paths
 *     keep compiling until the enum migration sweep.
