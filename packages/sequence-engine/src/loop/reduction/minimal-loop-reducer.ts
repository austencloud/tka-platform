/**
 * Minimal-Loop Reducer
 *
 * Collapses a sequence that is a LITERAL repeat of a shorter, already-closing
 * loop down to that shortest closing loop.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The strict quartered LOOP executors (mirrored / flipped / swapped / inverted)
 * build `period` passes unconditionally. A pass beyond the natural period-2
 * close is only meaningful when orientation DRIFTS between passes (half-turn
 * seeds, per-hand turn total ≡ 1 or 3 mod 4). For a zero-turn seed the loop
 * already closes in position AND orientation at period 2, so the extra passes
 * come out byte-for-byte identical — a redundant literal repeat.
 *
 * Concrete failure this fixes (2026-07-10): a `YΦΔYΦΔYΦΔYΦΔ` (12-step) deck
 * card that is a 6-step mirrored loop (`YΦΔ` seed → vertical mirror) copied a
 * second time. The 6-step loop already closes; the outer doubling is noise.
 * Canonical smallest form of a repeating word is its shortest form
 * (`simplified-word-display` rule) — the same principle at the STEP level.
 *
 * ## What it collapses (and what it must NOT)
 *
 * Collapse ONLY a LITERAL repeat: the second (and any later) pass is identical
 * to the first in every motion field INCLUDING orientation. That guarantee is
 * what makes the shorter prefix a valid seamless loop on its own.
 *
 *   - Mirrored / rotated / swapped loops whose halves are TRANSFORMS of each
 *     other (not copies) do NOT collapse — the halves differ in location, so
 *     `motionEquivalent` returns false. The transform is preserved.
 *   - Orientation-cycle loops (genuine multi-pass, where the repeat carries a
 *     DIFFERENT start orientation each pass) do NOT collapse — the orientation
 *     fields differ, so the passes are not literal copies. Preserved.
 *
 * The reducer therefore only ever removes truly redundant content and never
 * changes what a sequence actually does.
