/**
 * Partial Sequence Generator (Stub)
 *
 * Generates partial sequences constrained to end at a specific position,
 * which is the prerequisite for LOOP execution. The partial sequence is
 * the "seed" that gets transformed (rotated, mirrored, etc.) by the
 * LOOP executors.
 *
 * This is a complex service in the app that depends on:
 * - ILetterQueryHandler (loads all pictograph variations)
 * - IPictographFilter (filters by continuity, rotation, etc.)
 * - IStepConverter (converts pictograph data to StepData)
 * - ITurnManager (allocates and sets turns)
 * - IOrientationCalculator (updates orientations)
 * - IArrowPositioningOrchestrator (calculates arrow placements)
 * - ILOOPParameterProvider (allocates turns, determines rotation directions)
 *
 * Full implementation will be wired in Chunk 4 when the unified builder
 * integrates this with the constrained builder. For now, the interface
 * and shape are preserved so downstream code can reference it.
 *
 * Ported interface from app's PartialSequenceGenerator.ts.
