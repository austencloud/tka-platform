/**
 * Aiming a generated sequence at a layer signature.
 *
 * A sequence's layer signature — which of the four radial/non-radial
 * combinations the two props sit in, step by step — is decided entirely by its
 * turns. Nothing about the letters, the positions, or the hand paths moves it.
 * That is what makes it targetable: to put a step in a chosen layer you only
 * have to make each prop either cross or not cross, and every motion can be
 * made to do either by nudging its turn value.
 *
 * The nudge is small and always the same shape. A prop crosses when its turn
 * value is a half — 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 — and stays put when the value is whole. So
 * asking a motion to cross means adding a half turn to it, and asking it not to
 * means dropping the half back off. A float always crosses (a float only ever
 * happens on a shift, and a shift always carries the hand around the circle),
 * so a float that has been asked to stay put becomes an ordinary spin again.
 *
 * Two things follow, and both show up in real sequences:
 *
 *   Non-radial is a level 3 idea. Level 1 has no turns and level 2 has only
 *   whole ones, so no prop below level 3 can leave radial at all: those
 *   sequences are not just frozen, they are frozen in layer 1. Half turns
 *   arrive at level 3, and from there every signature is reachable.
 *
 *   A sequence that repeats needs each prop to cross an even number of times,
 *   or the second time through starts in a different layer than the first and
 *   the whole thing looks different on the repeat.
 *
 * Retargeting changes turn values, which changes the orientations that follow
 * from them. Run this BEFORE orientation propagation, or propagate again after.
