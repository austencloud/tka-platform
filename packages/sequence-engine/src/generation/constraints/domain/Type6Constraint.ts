/**
 * Type 6 Constraint
 *
 * Type 6 letters (α, β, γ) are static — no hand movement, only prop rotation.
 * At level 1, they're excluded entirely because L1 only has 0-turn motions,
 * and a 0-turn static letter is just "stand there doing nothing."
 * At level 2+, they're allowed only when at least one hand has turns > 0,
 * so the props are actually doing something while the hands hold still.
 *
 * This only gets a say when static letters are in the candidate pool at all,
 * which BuildOptions.allowStaticSteps controls — on by default only when the
 * caller set a turn pattern or a layer target. LetterClassifier additionally
 * treats ζ, η, τ and ⊕ as Type 6; those are synthesized position placeholders
 * rather than alphabet letters, and never reach the pool.
