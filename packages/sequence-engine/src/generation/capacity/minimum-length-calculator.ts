/**
 * Minimum Length Calculator
 *
 * Closed-form answer to: "What's the smallest sequence length that can
 * produce a LOOP of the given (loopType, period, level) configuration?"
 *
 * Used by the generator UI to disable infeasible length chips before the
 * user commits to a generate action. Prevents the "spinner forever, then
 * failure" pattern — infeasibility shows up as a greyed-out chip with an
 * explanation, which is cheaper than blowing beam search.
 *
 * ## Math
 *
 * Every LOOP at period N has a structural minimum equal to:
 *
 *   N · basePatternMinimum(loopType, level)
 *
 * where `basePatternMinimum` is the shortest base sequence that a single
 * pass of the LOOP can extend non-trivially.
 *
 * At level 1, `basePatternMinimum` is 2 for transformations that need
 * distinct beats to demonstrate the transformation (rotation, mirror, flip,
 * swap) and 1 for stateless transformations (inverted). At level ≥ 2, float
 * motions allow period-4 closure within a single beat for some transforms.
 *
 * ## Level-specific capacity gates
 *
 * Level 1 has 0-turn motions only. Orientation cannot drift — so any LOOP
 * that requires orientation cycling (period > 1 via orientation domain)
 * is infeasible at level 1 → returns Infinity.
 *
 * Level 2+ enables half-turn (180°) motions. Level 5 adds the 8-grid which
 * expands position-domain period 8 possibilities. Level 7+ adds the 8-wheel
 * which expands orientation-domain period 8. Both level 5/7 still land
 * under the same min-length formula, just with period 8 added as valid.
 *
 * ## Domain
 *
 * When the caller knows the LOOP operates purely in orientation domain
 * (positions stay pinned), the minimum equals just `period` beats — one
 * beat per pass, since positions can hold while orientations advance.
