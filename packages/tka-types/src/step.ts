/**
 * Step — one beat of sequence content.
 *
 * Canonical replacement for:
 *   - `SequenceStep` in packages/sequence-engine/src/core/types/sequence-engine-types.ts
 *   - `StepData` in src/lib/shared/pictograph/** (app copy)
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - `letter` is a Letter enum or null; start-position steps have null.
 *   - `motions` is a performer-relative keyed record (left/right).
 *     Hand-iterating algorithms become one loop instead of duplicated blocks.
 *   - `stepNumber` is required; 0 marks the start-position step.
 *   - Reversal state (`leftReversal`/`rightReversal`) is derived on read via
 *     `deriveReversals(steps)` in `@tka/sequence-engine`, not stored here.
 *   - Selection state (`isSelected`) is UI state; it lives in a selection
 *     store in the app layer, keyed by step `id`.
 *   - `id` is required — enables stable keying for selection + diffing.
 *
 * All fields readonly. Builders (see `./builders.ts`) enforce immutability
 * and runtime-validate required fields.
