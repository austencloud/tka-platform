      "A distinction that arises in asymmetric positions (gamma, zeta, eta) when both hands shift the same direction. One hand is directionally 'ahead' of the other, creating a leader and a follower. This matters for letter assignment because the leader and follower can have different turn values. In the TKA glyph, the leader's turn number appears on top, the follower's on bottom. Leader/follower does NOT apply to opposite-direction movement (hands diverge/converge symmetrically) or to symmetric positions (alpha, beta). Leader/follower is combinatorially equivalent to mixed motion types: it doubles the variation space the same way that having one pro and one anti does.",
