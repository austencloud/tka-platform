/**
 * 9-Square Spatial Grid
 *
 * Charlie Cushing's 9-Square Theory quantizes poi space into a grid around the body.
 * Positions have origins, destinations, and purposes. The grid enables finding
 * transitions between movements, switching between diamond and box mode via
 * soft transitions, and creating algorithms for changing timing/direction
 * through CAPs and polyrhythm hybrids.
 *
 * Recommended poi length: 1/2 arm length for optimal 9-square patterns.
