## The 6 Letter Types

| Type | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Dual-Shift | Both hands shift |
| 2 | Shift | One shifts, one static |
| 3 | Cross-Shift | One shifts + one dashes |
| 4 | Dash | One dashes, one static |
| 5 | Dual-Dash | Both hands dash |
| 6 | Static | Both hands stationary |

## CRITICAL: Motion Type Precision

**NEVER say "both hands move" as the distinguishing feature of Type 1.**

Multiple types have both hands moving:
- Type 1: Both hands **shift** (adjacent movement)
- Type 3: Both hands move (one shifts, one dashes)
- Type 5: Both hands **dash** (opposite movement)

What makes Type 1 unique is that both hands **shift** - not that both move.

## The "-" Suffix Convention

When a user says "[Letter] dash", they mean the Type 3 or Type 5 letter with "-" suffix:

- "Sigma dash" → Σ- (Type 3)
- "Phi dash" → Φ- (Type 5)

## Positions (Hand Locations)

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Alpha | Hands at opposite points |
| Beta | Hands at the same point |
| Gamma | Hands form a right angle |
| Zeta | Hands form an obtuse angle |
| Eta | Hands form an acute angle |

## Position IS the gap — the letter algebra (established 2026-08-05)

Alpha/Beta/Gamma are not three unrelated arrangements. They are one coordinate:
the **gap** between the hands, measured on the 8-point ring.

| Gap | Position | VTG timing |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Beta | Together |
| 2 or 6 | Gamma | Quarter |
| 4 | Alpha | Split |

**A letter is `(motion character, gap)`, and this is measured, not a metaphor:**
288 motion characters × 4 gaps = 1152 pictographs, every character hitting every
gap exactly once, 100%, zero exceptions. The 47 letters are a coarser naming
laid over those cells.

Consequences you must not get wrong:

- **A, G and S are one motion at three separations** — same type, same both
  motions, same both rotation directions. `compare_letters("S","A")` finds the
  position family as the ONLY difference. Same for B/H/T, C/I/U/V, D/J/M/P etc.
  — the 13 families in `docs/reference/letter-gap-families.md`.
- **Gamma occupies TWO of the four gap slots.** That is why quarter-same has
  four letters (S, T, U, V) where alpha and beta get three: S and T are their
  own gamma partner, while the hybrid character splits into U and V — the pair
  canon already calls leader/follower (U leader=pro, V leader=anti).
  A family is size 3 when the two gamma slots share a name, size 4 when they
  do not. Nothing else varies.
- **`compare_letters` cannot tell M from P** — it reports "no major
  differences", because the distinguishing coordinate is the gap slot and the
  tool does not carry it. Do not conclude two letters are identical from that.
- **A sequence's orbit** is every letter walking its family in lockstep.
  Verified: `AJGD` rotated 90° is `SPSM`, letter for letter, and reversal
  structure is invariant across the orbit (both report 3 unavoidable).
- **Skew (45°, one hand) is 0% expressible** from shipped data — 1152 of 1152
  land off the map. Diamond↔box (45°, BOTH hands) is letter-preserving.

## Motion Types

| Type | Movement |
|------|----------|
| Static | Hand stays at current point |
| Shift | Hand moves to adjacent point |
| Dash | Hand moves to opposite point |

**Dash carries `noRotation`, exactly like static.** When judging prop
continuity, treat a channel as active only when it reads `cw` or `ccw` and walk
transparently past everything else — guard on the VALUE, never on a motion-type
list. A dash is not a prop reversal.

## Communication Style

Assume zero domain knowledge from the user. Use precise terminology:

**DO say:**
- "Hands start at opposite points (alpha) and end at the same point (beta)"
- "Blue hand at south, red hand at east - that's gamma (hands form a right angle)"

**DON'T say:**
- "Hands together" (vague)
- "Props parallel" (position isn't about props)
- "180 degrees apart" (implementation detail)
