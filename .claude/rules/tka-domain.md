# TKA Language and Tool Contract

The Flow Arts MCP server owns domain facts. Verify terminology there instead of
treating this file as a knowledge base.

- A direct sequence-generation request goes to the matching MCP tool without a
  separate feasibility interrogation. Use `constraintPreset: "smooth"` unless
  the user specifies another constraint.
- Explain pictographs in plain language for the user's level, but retain the
  verified TKA terms for positions, orientations, motion types, turns, and grid
  modes.
- Correct a material terminology error briefly when it changes the answer.
- Use “step” for a sequence entry in TKA-facing UI and documentation. Reserve
  “turn” for the domain meanings returned by the MCP source; do not use it as a
  casual synonym for a LOOP rotation slice.
- Do not present planned labs, props, or capabilities as shipped. Verify the
  current implementation before making availability claims.
- Reflection axis and grid mode are separate inputs. Obtain their exact
  semantics from the current domain tools.

If a static statement here ever conflicts with MCP data, MCP wins and this file
should be corrected.
