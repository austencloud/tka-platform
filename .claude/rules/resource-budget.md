# Local Resource Budget

Apply this before starting a Vite server, `svelte-check`, `npm run check`, or a
full build.

1. Reuse an existing task-appropriate server when possible. Never touch the
   project server on port 5173.
2. Check available memory. Do not start a heavy process below 4096 MB available.
3. Check for an existing `svelte-check`; only one may run machine-wide. Wait for
   it instead of starting another.
4. At most two agent-owned Vite servers may run concurrently. If the cap is
   reached, reuse one or report contention.
5. Stop every server and wrapper process started by the current task before the
   turn ends.

PowerShell probes:

```powershell
(Get-Counter '\Memory\Available MBytes').CounterSamples[0].CookedValue
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='node.exe'" |
  Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -match 'svelte-check|vite\\bin\\vite\.js' } |
  Select-Object ProcessId, CommandLine
```

Do not kill another task's process to satisfy the budget. Prefer focused checks
and stop after the evidence required by `AGENTS.md` passes.
