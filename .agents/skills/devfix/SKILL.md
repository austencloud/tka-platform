description: Use when local dev infrastructure is broken — dev.tkaflowarts.com shows 502/503, the dev server won't serve, https/certificate errors, the Cloudflare tunnel is down, the Codex launcher or right-click context menu broke, or "fix my dev environment". Encodes the known failure modes so they're diagnosed in minutes, not rediscovered.

# Fix Dev Infrastructure

When explicitly invoked, treat the text after `$devfix` as `<arguments>`. Expected shape: `[symptom, e.g. 'dev.tkaflowarts.com 502']`.

**Args:** `<arguments>`

The stack: Vite serves **HTTPS/2** on `:5173` (mkcert certs in `.cert/`),
cloudflared runs the locally-managed `tka-dev` tunnel exposing it as
`https://dev.tkaflowarts.com`. `scripts/start-dev.ps1` orchestrates both and
its header comments are the canonical doc — read it before theorizing.

**`:5173` is Austen's server.** Never start/kill/restart it yourself — not by
`npm run dev`, not by running `scripts/start-dev.ps1`, not via pm2, not by
killing the port holder. **He restarts it from a button in Agent Hub**, which
carries the tunnel and pm2 supervision a hand-run vite does not. Diagnose
freely, then ask him to press it. See
`.claude/rules/never-start-the-dev-server.md`.

Diagnose with `curl -k -g 'https://[::1]:5173/'` — `dev` is `vite --host ::`
(IPv6), so plain `localhost` resolves to IPv4 and returns `000` on a healthy
server.

## First: split the fault domain

```powershell
curl.exe -k -s -o NUL -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 https://localhost:5173/
curl.exe -s -o NUL -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 10 https://dev.tkaflowarts.com/
```

| 000   | 502    | Vite isn't serving — ask Austen to start/restart it                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 200   | 502    | Tunnel connected before Vite finished cold boot (the race `start-dev.ps1` now gates against), or cloudflared died — ask him to restart from Agent Hub                                                                    |
| 200   | 503    | Token-based tunnel run missing `--url` — locally-managed tunnels get **no ingress rules** with a token; every request 503s. `start-dev.ps1` passes `--url https://localhost:5173`; a hand-started tunnel probably didn't |
| 200   | 200    | Nothing wrong with the stack — the bug is elsewhere                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Known failure modes

- **`http://` anywhere → ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE.** The dev server is HTTPS/h2
  only. Every localhost URL, curl, and link is `https://`.
- **Tunnel origin TLS:** cloudflared can't read the Windows trust store for
  the mkcert CA → runs need `--no-tls-verify` (script handles it).
- **Tunnel credentials:** `%USERPROFILE%\.cloudflared\tka-dev.token` (or
  `cert.pem` from `cloudflared tunnel login`). Missing both → script skips the
  tunnel with a warning; dev.tkaflowarts.com stays dead. Refresh a token via
  `cloudflared tunnel token tka-dev` on a logged-in machine.
- **allowedHosts:** Vite only answers for hosts in `vite.config.ts`
  `server.allowedHosts` (includes `dev.tkaflowarts.com`). A new hostname needs
  adding there.
- **`Cannot find module` during initialization:** run
  `pnpm run verify:workspace-install` as a read-only diagnosis. A package
  directory can exist while its files are missing, and a normal `pnpm install`
  may still report "Already up to date." The Agent Hub launcher now checks all
  declared package manifests plus the boot-critical imports before Vite starts.
  When the check fails it force-rebuilds from the frozen lockfile, rebuilds the
  workspace packages, verifies again, and gives Vite one clean optimizer pass.
  If that repair still fails, the launcher deliberately leaves Vite stopped and
  prints the package that is still broken instead of caching the failure.
- **Launcher / context menu:** `launchers/start-codex.bat` and
  `launchers/install-codex-context-menu.ps1` (registry `HKCU` key pointing at
  the Codex install — reinstalls move the path; rerun the installer script).
- **Whole-machine setup:** `launchers/bootstrap-machine.ps1` replicates the
  full agent scaffolding on a fresh machine (CLIs, context menus, launcher
  shortcuts, global Claude/Codex config, pm2 stack, PrtSc→F13 remap). It is
  idempotent, so it also works as a repair-everything pass here; assets live
  in `launchers/bootstrap-assets/`.

## After any fix

Prove it: rerun both curls and show the codes, or have Austen confirm the
page loads. Config-only changes still follow `verification-protocol.md`.
