# Feedback Workflow

When explicitly invoked, treat the text after `$fb` as `<arguments>`. Expected shape: `[feedback-id]`.

Work on a feedback item from the queue.

## Usage

- `$fb` - Auto-claim next feedback item
- `$fb <id>` - Claim and work on a specific feedback item
- `$fb list` - Show queue

## Arguments

<arguments> - Optional feedback ID (first 8+ characters), or "list"

## Instructions

### Step 1: Fetch (ONE shell call)

| Input       | Command                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| No argument | `node scripts/fetch-feedback.js`                   |
| ID provided | `node scripts/fetch-feedback.js claim <arguments>` |
| "list"      | `node scripts/fetch-feedback.js list`              |

Auth is cached. Do not run `whoami`, `mine`, or any other pre-check. Go straight to the command above.

If auth fails (first-time setup), run `node scripts/fetch-feedback.js login`, then retry.

### Step 2: Display + Triage

Show: title, ID, type, priority, submitter, module/tab, full description.

If images attached, read each from disk AND open for user: `powershell -Command "Invoke-Item '<path>'"`

Assess complexity without hard-coding a model name:

- **TRIVIAL** (low effort): String swaps, single-line fixes, known solution
- **MEDIUM** (medium effort): CSS fixes, single-file changes, clear bugs with repro
- **COMPLEX** (high effort): Multi-module, ambiguous requirements, 4+ files, new infra

Announce triage: complexity, recommended reasoning effort, reasoning. Ask for confirmation before implementing.

After approval:

1. `/rename FB: [short title]`
2. Reconfirm the claim before editing:
   ```powershell
   node scripts/fetch-feedback.js claim <id>
   ```

This command is required even when the item was just claimed. It refreshes the
same agent session or reclaims an expired lease after a long approval delay. If
another live session owns the item, stop and report the conflict.

### Step 3: Implement

Work the item. Use heartbeats for long sessions:

```powershell
node scripts/fetch-feedback.js heartbeat <id> "status"
```

When done:

```powershell
node scripts/fetch-feedback.js <id> in-review "Brief admin notes"
```
