# Monolith Detection

## Run

```powershell
npx -p @austencloud/code-quality ac-monolith --auto-claim
```

## Workflow

1. **Parse CLAIMED_FILE** from output
2. **Read the file** and identify responsibilities
3. **Evaluate with Four Perspectives** (see below)
4. **Propose decomposition OR mark as audited**
5. **Get confirmation** before proceeding
6. **Extract** following project conventions, or mark audited
7. **Release claim** when done

## Critical Guardrails

### The Single Responsibility Test

Line count is a signal, not a rule. The real question:

> "Can I describe what this file does in one sentence without using 'and'?"

A 1500-line orchestrator that wires children together is fine. A 400-line file with 6 tangled responsibilities is not.

### Four Perspectives Test

Evaluate through all four before proposing changes:

1. **Architect** - Is the boundary at the right level?
2. **Pragmatist** - Can I find a bug in 5 minutes?
3. **Skeptic** - Am I solving a real problem or just uncomfortable with size?
4. **Svelte Component** - Are there extractable UI sections?

**Convergence:** 3/4 must agree before proceeding.

### When to Extract

| Extract When | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Distinct UI section with own markup + CSS | Header, Footer, SplitPane |
| Reusable logic in multiple places | Validation, formatting |
| Logic that needs unit testing (silent bugs) | Calculations, algorithms |
| A section you can't describe without "and" | "handles swipe AND export AND sync" |

### When NOT to Extract

- It's orchestration (wiring children, managing flow)
- Extraction creates thin wrappers with no logic
- The "duplication" is actually encapsulation
- You're uncomfortable with size but can't name the responsibility

### Common Traps

**The Thin Wrapper Trap:** Extracting services that add files but no value. If the extracted class is just a passthrough with no logic of its own, you created 7 files and ~240 lines for nothing. Only extract when the piece has its own responsibility.

**The "It's An Orchestrator" Excuse:** Concluding "leave it alone" for a 2000+ line file because "it orchestrates children." Check if it has 5+ distinct UI sections each with their own markup + CSS. If so, those sections are extractable components, not orchestration.

### The Real Test

1. Can a new developer know what it does from the filename?
2. Can you delete it without breaking unrelated features?
3. Can you find a bug in under 60 seconds?

If yes to all three, it's fine regardless of line count.

## Two Valid Outcomes

### Option A: Decompose

Extract following project conventions. Get user confirmation first.

### Option B: Mark as Audited

```powershell
npx -p @austencloud/code-quality ac-monolith --mark-audited "src/lib/path/to/File.svelte" "Reason: [what it does]. [Why size is inherent]."
```

**Always offer this when concluding "leave it alone."**
