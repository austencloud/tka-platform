 * Render-parity wave gate (see tests/render-parity/render-parity.test.ts).
 *
 * Browser-mode project because the pipeline under test is the REAL pictograph
 * pipeline (hydrate -> PictographPreparer -> Canvas2DDirectRenderer) — it
 * needs canvas, Image decode, and the SVG assets under static/ (hence
 * publicDir, which the components config doesn't need).
 *
 * Mode is injected at config time (cross-env in package.json scripts):
 *   RENDER_PARITY_MODE=self     (default) self-contained harness tests
 *   RENDER_PARITY_MODE=capture  freeze a baseline before a migration wave
 *   RENDER_PARITY_MODE=compare  diff current renders against the baseline
