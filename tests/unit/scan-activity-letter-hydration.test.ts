/**
 * Scan Activity renders decoded shortcodes with letters.
 *
 * A decoded QR payload is letterless by construction — `decodeSequence`
 * stamps `letter: null` on every step because the wire format carries motions,
 * not letters. A letterless pictograph misses BOTH arrow-adjustment tiers:
 * special placement needs a letter to build its key, and the default-placement
 * key degrades to a bare motion type ("pro") because detectLayerInfo cannot
 * classify alpha/beta/gamma without one. No default_*_placements.json defines
 * a bare motion-type key, so the lookup returns (0,0) and every arrow renders
 * on its raw hand point.
 *
 * Scan Activity's card peek was the one decoded-shortcode surface that skipped
 * the canonical hydrator (/q, /sequence/[id], the viewer drawer and the
 * scan-cell warmer all run it), which is why the bug showed there and nowhere
 * else.
