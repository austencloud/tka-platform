 * Create a viewer3d state inside a fresh effect root and return both the

 * factory directly because the factory registers $effect internally — that
 * requires a component or an effect root to exist at call time.
 *
 * If a test doesn't pass its own `viewer3DUndoManager`, a real one is
 * instantiated — it's pure TypeScript with no side effects, so it's fine
 * to use in unit tests.
