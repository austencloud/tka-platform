/**
 * Scan-import hydration round-trip.
 *
 * Repro for the "scanned card files a husk" bug (2026-07-05): a printed card
 * whose shortcode record only carries the encoded blob resolves through
 * decodeSequence, gets saved as a private copy, and then renders EMPTY in the
 * viewer. saveSequence never persists steps — it derives compositional fields
 * (ensureComposition) at write time and re-derives steps from them at read
 * time (hydrate). If that derivation chain breaks for decoded sequences, the
 * stored doc has neither steps nor a way to rebuild them.
 *
 * This test walks the exact production pipeline:
 *   encode → decode (resolveForImport's encoded-blob path)
 *   → ensureComposition (saveSequence write path)
 *   → strip steps (the Firestore write shape)
 *   → hydrate (the read path)
 * and asserts the steps survive.
