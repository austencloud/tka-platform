/**
 * Golden-fixture snapshot of the combinator RESEARCH ORACLE.
 *
 * Source: `scripts/combinator-research/` (`enumerate.mjs`, `by-count.mjs`,
 * `pair-classes.mjs`, `theory-512.mjs`), transcribed 2026-08-05 from that
 * directory's own printed output and from `docs/reference/letter-gap-families.md`
 * ("What a card pair's fingerprint measures", "Compound cards", and the
 * `by-count.mjs` A+G run). These numbers were NOT re-measured when this file
 * was written — see the one exception noted on `SMOKE_CHECKED_AG_WORDS` below.
 * Re-running the originating scripts is how you'd re-verify them from
 * scratch; this file exists so the app engine has something fixed to check
 * itself against without paying that cost on every test run.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITS — carried forward from `scripts/combinator-research/README.md`.
 * Read that file before trusting any number below, and DO NOT treat a
 * mismatch between the app engine and this fixture as automatically the
 * app's bug — it may be a legitimate difference in equivalence relation
 * (limit 3).
 *
 *   1. Diamond mode only. The oracle never loads BoxPictographDataframe.csv.
 *   2. The closure test is a REIMPLEMENTATION of the app's rule (a local
 *      D4 x colour-swap group over position pairs). Verified 2026-08-05 to
 *      agree with `isLOOPValidForPositionPair`
 *      (`packages/sequence-engine/src/loop/validation/LOOPValidator.ts`) —
 *      but the real engine must call the app's validator, not this.
 *   3. Counts are sensitive to the equivalence relation the oracle quotients
 *      by: cyclic rotation of the unit, whole-sequence D4 x swap symmetry,
 *      AND the one-hand-rotation orbit. Change any of those and every number
 *      below moves. An early version of the oracle omitted the orbit quotient
 *      and reported 512 for A+G where the correct figure is 256 — a number
 *      that looks plausible is not evidence it came from the right relation.
 *   4. 45 degrees (skew) is excluded entirely — the shipped skewed dataframe
 *      has no rows that start FROM a skewed position, so skew faces cannot
 *      be resolved.
 *   5. Turns are ignored; everything below is 0-turn.
 *   6. Standard box for every fingerprint below, unless noted otherwise:
 *      unit length <= 6 steps, <= 2 connectors, diamond grid, both cards
 *      required to appear in the closed unit.
