/**
 * The splice builder — where a graph walk becomes something performable.
 *
 * The payoff this suite exists to prove: a spliced walk over TWO DIFFERENT
 * cards has a valid orientation chain end to end. The search only guarantees
 * positions; `buildResult` re-derives orientations from the walk's own start
 * hold, and `validateSequence` (the create module's orientation-continuity
 * validator) is the independent check that it worked.
 *
 * `validateSequence` is imported from `features/` deliberately and ONLY here —
 * `shared/` source may never import from `features/`, but a test may reach for
 * the app's own validator rather than re-deriving the rule it enforces.
 *
 * What `validateSequence` does and does NOT prove: it checks ADJACENCY only —
 * every step's start orientation equals its predecessor's end orientation, with
 * step 1 measured against the start hold. It cannot tell a correct chain from a
 * consistently-wrong one, because it never recomputes what an end orientation
 * OUGHT to be. The pinned chain in the wrap test and the oracle-style
 * assertions below (exact letters, exact dot positions, exact period) are what
 * carry correctness; adjacency is the cheap invariant on top.
