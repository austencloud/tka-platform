/**
 * The comparison suite's first exercised path.
 *
 * `src/lib/shared/comparison/` sat orphaned: fully written, never imported by
 * anything a user could reach, and every getter in it guarded `browser`-only —
 * which meant the one environment that could run it (the browser) took the real
 * path while every test took a caller's fallback. Task 12 gives it a visible
 * consumer (the similarity panel in the combinator lab) and this suite pins the
 * contract that consumer reads.
 *
 * What is asserted here is deliberately narrow: the CALCULATOR and the ALIGNER.
 * `SequenceCanonicalizer`'s hash carries three known defects (cited on
 * `walk-classifier.ts`'s `contentDedupKey`) and nothing here leans on it.
