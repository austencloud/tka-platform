/**
 * The whole pipeline against the published research oracle.
 *
 * `scripts/combinator-research/by-count.mjs` enumerated A + G inside the
 * standard box — unit <= 6 steps, <= 2 connectors, diamond, both cards required
 * — and its printed count-bucket profile is frozen in `oracle-fixtures.ts`. That
 * script is a separate implementation with its own local closure rule; the
 * engine here calls the app's `isLOOPValidForPositionPair` instead. Two
 * independent paths landing on the same nine numbers is the strongest evidence
 * available that the engine enumerates the right space and quotients it by the
 * right relation.
 *
 * A disagreement is NOT automatically the engine's bug — it may be a deliberate
 * change to the equivalence relation. But it must then be stated out loud, and
 * this file is where it would be stated.
 *
 * Runtime: the A+G sweep is a few million DFS nodes plus a canonicalisation
 * pass over every closing walk. It runs once for the whole file.
