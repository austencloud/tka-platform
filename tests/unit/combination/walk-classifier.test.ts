/**
 * Layer 2 — verdicts, content dedup and ranking.
 *
 * The search hands over closed walks; this layer decides what they MEAN and
 * which of them a human should see first. Three claims carry the suite:
 *
 *   1. The verdict is read off the block shape against each card's REPEAT UNIT,
 *      so "two G steps" (GGGG's unit is one step) and "two FALG steps" (unit
 *      four) are labelled differently even though both are two-step blocks.
 *      Alternation is judged around the CYCLE, because a combination is a loop.
 *   2. Dedup is on CONTENT and is PHASE-INVARIANT — the same loop entered at a
 *      different step is the same loop. `SequenceCanonicalizer` is not
 *      phase-invariant (three defects cited on `contentDedupKey`), which is why
 *      its hash is carried as a label and never deduped on.
 *   3. The presentation order is NOT the search's shortest-first order. That
 *      was a measured problem at Task 6: the shortest walks of GGGG + HHHH are
 *      two-step "one G, one H" loops, and a default page of 24 filled up with
 *      them.
 *
 * Every expected string here is DISPLAY-layer output (`simplifyRepeatedWord`),
 * so "GGGG" reads as "G" — the data layer's full expansion still lives on
 * `sequence.word`.
