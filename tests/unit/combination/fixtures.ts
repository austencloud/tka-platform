/**
 * Ground-truth fixtures for the sequence-combination engine — the suite's view
 * of them.
 *
 * The cards themselves and the builder that constructs them now live in
 * `src/lib/shared/combination/domain/demo-fixtures.ts`, because the
 * `/test/sequence-combinator` lab loads the same known-good material as its
 * presets and a `tests/` module cannot be imported from `src/`. Nothing about
 * the data changed in the move; that file carries the full provenance and the
 * per-card transcriptions.
 *
 * What stays here is what only a test wants: the standalone bridge STEPS, the
 * seam reader, and the whole-corpus roll-ups that `fixtures.test.ts` asserts
 * over. Import from "./fixtures" exactly as before.
