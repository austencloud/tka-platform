/**
 * Static contract test for the one-surface 3D prop picker.
 *
 * Choosing a 3D prop happens through the canonical BentoPropGrid, composed by
 * ScenePropPicker with the controls that only exist in a spatial scene. Before
 * that was true the performer inspector owned a second card grid, family
 * selector, and visual language that drifted from every other prop surface.
 *
 * This test locks the shape that fixed it: every host renders the shared
 * picker, no host reaches past it into its parts, and the picker's own choices
 * come from the catalog rather than a private list.
 *
 * The Prop Studio was the second host and is now none: it mounts
 * SceneControlWorkspace, the rail every other 3D stage carries, so its props
 * are chosen inside the performer inspector like everywhere else. It stays
 * below as a NON_HOST — it must never grow its own picker back.
 *
 * If this test fails, fix the host — do not loosen the assertions.
