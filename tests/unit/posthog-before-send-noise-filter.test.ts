/**
 * `dropKnownNoise` is the `before_send` hook wired into `posthog.init(...)`.
 * Its return contract is the one place a bug is invisible in production: a
 * branch that returns `undefined` instead of the event is indistinguishable
 * to posthog-js from an explicit `null`, and BOTH silently drop the event
 * with no exception, no failed build, no console error a developer would
 * notice — see the contract comment above `dropKnownNoise` in posthog.ts.
 * These tests exist to make that regression visible in CI instead of in a
 * days-later "why did $exception volume flatline" investigation.
