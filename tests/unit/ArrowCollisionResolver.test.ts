/**
 * ArrowCollisionResolver Tests
 *
 * When two hands end at the same grid location, their arrows visually stack
 * and become unreadable. A wrong offset direction or a missed collision would
 * be silent — the card would just look broken. These tests lock in the
 * detector's behavior for both collision and non-collision cases, and for
 * the diagonal offset logic that fans colliding arrows apart.
