/**
 * Task 3 of docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-24-film-director-plane-axes.md:
 * "wire resolved planes into the viewer." Task 2 (already landed) taught
 * `resolveFilmDirectorSpec` to resolve leftPlane/rightPlane/stepPlanes per
 * performer and scene.visiblePlanes per scene. This file proves the adapter
 * actually carries those resolved values onto the viewer/character-instance
 * layer:
 *
 *  (a) `buildDirectorViewerSeed` puts the resolved planes on the seed.
 *  (b) `applyDirectorSceneToViewer` clears a PREVIOUS scene's per-step plane
 *      overrides before the next scene's (possibly empty) list is applied -
 *      a stale override must never bleed into a cut that doesn't repeat it.
 *  (c) `applyDirectorSceneToViewer` sets whole-sequence hand planes on a
 *      REUSED performer instance across a scene transition.
