/**
 * Registration-ordering contract for the video export orchestrator.
 *
 * The factory registers as a side effect of
 * composition-root/deferred-registrations, which the root layout schedules on
 * an idle callback (2s timeout). Hosts that can reach a video export before
 * that idle slot — the Browse animation sheet, the sequence viewer shell's
 * export panel, the Create export drawer, the /q scan page — used to resolve
 * the orchestrator eagerly and threw
 * "VideoExportOrchestrator factory not registered".
 *
 * The fix is a single seam, ensureVideoExportOrchestrator(), which loads the
 * deferred registrations on demand. This test locks both halves: the seam
 * works, and no host resolves eagerly again.
