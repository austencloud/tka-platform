/**
 * Hand-Path Float Arrow Separation — Regression Test
 *
 * Two hands travelling the SAME path (tog-same dual-shifts: letter G/H, e.g.
 * both hands S→W) must render SEPARATED float arrows, not one arrow hidden
 * under the other. The system mechanism is the special-placement tier: the
 * letter's "(fl, fl)" entry gives the red arrow its own adjustment while blue
 * falls through to the default float placement — two different offsets, two
 * visible arrows. (Surfaced by the Level 1 guide rebuild, Tog-Same row.)
 *
 * Root cause of the overlap: PictographPreparer.transformForHandPath blanked
 * start/end orientations to `undefined` when converting PRO/ANTI shifts to
 * floats. That killed placement-key layer detection (default keys degraded to
 * a bare "float" miss → 0,0) and — with no letter or a letter but a broken
 * lookup context — both arrows landed identically. The fix keeps orientations
 * radial (IN), matching the static branch and hand start positions.
 *
 * Pipeline trace this test locks down (diamond G, both hands PRO S→W):
 *   - transformForHandPath → float, turns "fl", orientations stay "in"
 *   - generateOrientationKey → "in_in" → legacy bucket "from_layer1"
 *   - turnsTupleGenerator → "(fl, fl)"
 *   - G_placements.json "(fl, fl)" → red [80, -100]; blue absent → null
 *   - generatePlacementKey (blue fallback) → "float_to_layer1_beta" → [30, -30]
 *   - red base ≠ blue base → separated arrows
