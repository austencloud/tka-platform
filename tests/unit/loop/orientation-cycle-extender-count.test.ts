/**
 * Locks the contract behind the Extend drawer's "Repeated ×N" option.
 *
 * The drawer promises a repeat count BEFORE anything is applied
 * (getCycleCount, non-mutating) and then applies it (extendIfNeeded). If those
 * two ever disagreed, the button would advertise ×2 and produce ×4. They share
 * one start-orientation resolver so they cannot — this test is what keeps that
 * true.
