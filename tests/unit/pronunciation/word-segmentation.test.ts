 * Build speech-like audio: `count` tone bursts separated by silence. The gap
 * exceeds the trimmer's 200 ms merge window so the bursts stay distinct —
 * gaps quantize to whole 0.01s frames and the merge comparison is `<=`, so
 * 0.201s would still merge; the fixture's 0.25s default clears that with
 * room to spare. Each burst clears its 80 ms minimum-speech floor.
 *
 * `noiseAmplitude` fills the gaps with low-level room tone instead of digital
 * silence, so tests can exercise the noise-floor term of the detector's
 * threshold instead of leaving it permanently at zero.
