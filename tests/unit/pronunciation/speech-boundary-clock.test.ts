 * when a word began and ended. If those are measured against different origins
 * — a wall clock against a sample clock — the numbers still look like seconds,
 * the code still type-checks, and every single read comes back null. The
 * session re-queues each word without saying why, and stops a few words in.
 *
 * The existing session tests miss it because their fake capture returns samples
 * for any span asked of it. These use a real ring.
