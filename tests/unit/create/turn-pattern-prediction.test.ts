/**
 * The number the card shows before generating is the number that comes back.
 *
 * The Turns card reads out the layer signature a pattern will produce while the
 * user is still setting up — there is no sequence to measure yet, and no letters
 * have been chosen. That is only honest if the signature really is independent
 * of the letters: start layer, plus which props crossed, step by step.
 *
 * So this runs the real builder over three unrelated words with the same
 * pattern, measures the layers it actually produced, and compares them against
 * the app's prediction, which never sees any of it.
