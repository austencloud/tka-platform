/**
 * Parity locks for the trace game's geometry.
 *
 * The whole point of `trace-path-sampler` is that the line a player is graded
 * against is the SAME line the renderer draws. That guarantee is only worth
 * anything if something enforces it, so this file pins both halves:
 *
 *  1. Sampler vs renderer — every ordered pair of grid locations must produce
 *     the renderer's own curve, only rescaled.
 *  2. Hit-target coordinates vs the grid coordinate SSOT — the assemble lab
 *     carries its own hardcoded copy of the hand points. If that copy ever
 *     drifts from `gridCoordinates`, the trace game would arm on one point
 *     while the player taps another.
