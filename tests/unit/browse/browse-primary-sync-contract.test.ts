/**
 * Static contract test for BrowseModule's outer-tab -> inner-route sync.
 *
 * BrowseModule declares a `$effect` that pushes the global navigation's active
 * tab (Explore / You) into Browse's own route state. Svelte 5 flushes user
 * effects in source order, and that effect is declared above `onMount`, so on a
 * cold load it runs BEFORE `browseNavigationState.initialize()` has read the
 * URL. While `currentLocation` is still null the `activePrimary` derived falls
 * back to its "explore" default; comparing the nav tab against that default
 * made every direct hit on /browse/you/* look like a primary change, and the
 * resulting `selectPrimary("you")` rewrote the address bar to
 * /browse/you/sequences before `initialize()` ever saw the real path. Reloading
 * or bookmarking /browse/you/visuals/tunnels, /browse/you/videos, and
 * /browse/you/collections all threw the user back to Sequences.
 *
 * The effect must therefore bail until the route state has a location, and
 * compare against that location's primary rather than the derived default.
 *
 * If this test fails, keep the guard — do not loosen the assertions.
