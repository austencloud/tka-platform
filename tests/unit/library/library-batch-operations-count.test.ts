 * Deleting a batch uses one transaction PER sequence — owner doc, public

 * strand a public document whose owner is gone.
 *
 * Profile counts are server-owned projections maintained by Firestore triggers.
 * This file guards that clients never mutate those counters while preserving
 * per-sequence deletion reporting.
