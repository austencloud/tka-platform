/**
 * The motor, stubbed onto a virtual clock.
 *
 * Every primitive resolves immediately and advances a counter instead of
 * sleeping, so a four-hour tour runs in under a second. The only behaviour that
 * matters here is that a press really presses (the sim app mutates) and that
 * time really passes (restlessness, dwell gates and the invitation spacing all
 * read the clock, and freezing it would make them lie).
