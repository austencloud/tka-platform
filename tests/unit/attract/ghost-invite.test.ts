/**
 * The invitation family and the savor beat
 * (spec: 2026-08-05-ghost-presence-design.md).
 *
 * Both are cheap to get subtly wrong in ways nobody notices until the laptop
 * has been running for an hour in front of strangers:
 *
 * - An invitation that fires without its budget becomes a nag, and one that
 *   fires during playback or over a modal talks across the only good bit.
 * - `point-it-out` MUST leave its target unpressed. The unfinished action is
 *   the entire mechanism — if it presses, it is just another intention and the
 *   invitation evaporates.
 * - `savor` must be opt-in per intention forever. The global version of that
 *   behaviour was the "moves out of the way after clicking" bug (3b912bbc97).
