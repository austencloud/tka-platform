/**
 * The intelligence measurement harness.
 *
 * Not a contract — an instrument. It runs long sessions and writes one JSON
 * file of behavioural metrics so a change to the Ghost's mind can be argued
 * with numbers instead of vibes. Run it before a change and after, with the
 * same session count and length, then diff the two files.
 *
 *   GHOST_REPORT=1 GHOST_REPORT_LABEL=before pnpm exec vitest run \
 *     --environment jsdom tests/unit/attract/ghost-intelligence-report.test.ts
 *
 * The headline metric is WASTE: a step that landed, was not a perception, and
 * changed nothing observable in the world. A ghost that is learning should
 * waste less in the back half of a session than the front half, and a smarter
 * ghost should waste less overall. Everything else is there to explain why the
 * waste number moved — or to catch it moving for a bad reason (fewer wasted
 * steps because it stopped doing anything at all is not an improvement).
 *
 * Seeds do not survive a change to the mind: any edit shifts RNG consumption,
 * so seed 7 after is a different session from seed 7 before. That is why this
 * reports DISTRIBUTIONS over many sessions rather than a single replay.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FINDING, 2026-08-09 — the step-learning layer is a NULL RESULT. Read this
 * before spending another rung of work on the Ghost's planning.
 *
 * Measured A/B, 30 sessions per arm, 847 decisions each. The control arm was
 * produced with GHOST_MIN_STEP_EVIDENCE=999999, which puts the evidence bar out
 * of reach so no step is ever `proven` and nothing is pruned, re-planned, or
 * noticed as a dud. It is a clean switch: the pruned/noticed/replanned counters
 * read exactly 0 in control and non-zero in treatment.
 *
 *              control    treatment    SE of difference
 *   wasteRate   0.0920      0.0898         0.0032
 *   wasteLate   0.0882      0.0850         0.0036
 *   wasteDrift -0.0076     -0.0098         0.0052
 *
 * Every delta is inside one standard error. The layer fires (≈19 noticed duds,
 * 24 pruned steps, 7 re-plans per session) and changes no outcome.
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters:
 *
 *   1. Nothing rewards a lean plan. Episode value is
 *      achievement·0.6 + completion·0.2 + novelty·0.2 — there is no waste term
 *      anywhere. Pruning produces a variant plan that competes in
 *      `imagineActivityFutures` against the unpruned original and scores
 *      identically, so selection never converges on it. The Ghost can see the
 *      dead step and can build a plan without it, and has no reason to prefer
 *      that plan.
 *
 *   2. A THIRD OF THE WASTE SIGNAL IS THIS HARNESS, NOT THE GHOST.
 *      `jump-to-section` and `what-is-this-button` waste on 100% of ~600
 *      attempts because the synthetic app model below has no section anchors
 *      and no button-help surface — there is nothing there for them to move.
 *      Do not tune the value function against the waste number until the sim
 *      grows those surfaces; that is fitting the Ghost to a test double.
 *
 * The conclusion drawn with Austen: stop here. Strip the artifacts and real
 * waste is ~6%, most of it `play-it` replays that read to a viewer as a person
 * watching their sequence again — wanted behavior, not a defect. The Ghost's
 * planning is already finer-grained than anyone perceives in a 90-second glance
 * at a kiosk. The remaining gap is PRESENTATION, not cognition: the two changes
 * that visibly moved realism in this cycle (the pointer resting on what it
 * looks at instead of drifting to a screen corner, and the mind HUD covering
 * the Ghost) were both caught by eye in seconds and are invisible to every
 * metric in this file.
