/**
 * buildPlacementTransition shapes the in-place start-position move animation:
 * the moving prop gets a pro-with-zero-turns arc motion (forced "arc" path so
 * the global path-shape setting can't flatten it) and the partner stays a
 * static hold, so calculatePictographMotionPositions resolves its beta offset
 * via the prepared-endpoint correction lerp.
