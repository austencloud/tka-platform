/**
 * Live performers address beats by a motion-relative phase (0.00 = start of
 * beat 1). The state owner decides where beat 1 lives because it reserves
 * index 0 for a static start pose when the sequence carries one. Consumers
 * must read that offset instead of hardcoding it.
 *
 * `totalSteps` is `$derived` and only recomputes inside a reactive root, so
 * these tests probe the step list through `goToStep`, which clamps against
 * the raw list.
