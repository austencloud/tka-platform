/**
 * Locomotion anatomy
 *
 * The second anatomy layer. `rig-anatomy-contract.test.ts` reads a bind pose;
 * this drives one and grades the legs it produces, with `FootPlanter` in the
 * loop. That is the whole point of it: foot IK is where a leg is finally
 * posed, so the animator-only suite next door structurally cannot see an IK
 * defect, and the defect that prompted all of this lived exactly there.
 *
 * ## Why the existing rows could not catch it
 *
 * Measured, not argued. Rotating one knee's IK hinge 84 degrees off sagittal
 * on `ch01` at 3.9 m/s and re-reading the whole report:
 *
 * | injected tilt | knee bend plane | peak foot slip | knee jerk |
 * | ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------- |
 * | 0 deg         | 8.6 deg         | 9.2 cm         | 11187.982 |
 * | 45 deg        | 37.0 deg        | 9.2 cm         | 11187.982 |
 * | 84 deg        | 69.7 deg        | 9.2 cm         | 11187.982 |
 *
 * Not a coincidence, and not merely an empirical gap -- each of those rows is
 * structurally incapable of seeing this fault. The foot rows describe the path
 * the feet traced, and the fault does not move the feet; it folds the leg
 * between them. `kneeJerkRms` looks like it should notice, since it is about
 * the knee, but it is the second derivative of `kneeAngle`, and `kneeAngle` is
 * the unsigned interior angle at the joint. Turning the plane a knee bends in
 * leaves how far it bends exactly where it was. The two readings differ in
 * their eighth significant figure, which is the arithmetic taking a different
 * route to the same answer.
 *
 * `the report is blind without the anatomy rows` below pins all of that, so
 * the day one of those rows does start responding, this stops claiming a
 * blindness it no longer has.
 *
 * ## Where the bands came from
 *
 * All twelve shipped characters, walk and run, planter on: worst-side mean
 * plane tilt measured 7.5 to 12.1 degrees, which is also where the clinical
 * figure sits -- a healthy knee moves 8 to 12 degrees in the frontal plane
 * across a gait cycle. The warn line is 16 and the fail line 25.
 *
 * ## The floor, stated rather than implied
 *
 * The fault response is close to linear, about 0.88 degrees of reading per
 * degree of hinge error at a walk and 0.72 at a run, on a baseline that is
 * itself around 10. So a 20 degree miscalibration is caught at a walk and a 30
 * degree one anywhere, while a 10 degree one is inside the spread between
 * healthy characters and this layer will not see it. That is what the static
 * contract is for: it reads the axis directly, where 10 degrees is enormous.
 * Neither layer covers the other's range, and both are cheap.
