/**
 * Locomotion motion quality
 *
 * The rest of the locomotion suite checks plumbing: that a key exists, that a
 * band is arithmetic, that a clock advances. None of it can tell whether the
 * character on screen is moving like a person, because none of it ever poses a
 * skeleton. This does.
 *
 * It drives the real `LocomotionAnimator` with the real shipped clips on real
 * shipped rigs, reads the pose off the bones with the walk lab's own sampler,
 * and measures it with the walk lab's own analysis. Nothing here is a stand-in,
 * and that includes the retarget: the pack clips are authored on `mixamorig:`
 * and the avatars' bones are `mixamorig12:`, so every run goes through
 * `remapClipToSkeleton` exactly as the app does.
 *
 * The loading and driving live in `./locomotion-harness`, which every suite
 * that needs a posed skeleton shares.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot see
 *
 * `FootPlanter` IK and the arm pass run after the animator in `Avatar3D`, and
 * neither runs here: `driveRig` is called without `planting`. That is
 * deliberate -- it isolates the layer the run tier changed, so a correction
 * downstream cannot hide a defect upstream -- but it decides what may be
 * asserted. The anatomy suite is the one that turns the planter on.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: on `ch01` at 3.9 m/s this layer reports cadence 80/min
 * and a step length of 0 cm, while the same rig through the full pipeline in
 * the walk lab reports 133/min and 140.7 cm. Every contact-derived number --
 * cadence, step length, duty factor, foot slip, over-support, weight
 * alternation -- is dominated by the planter that is missing here, so asserting
 * on one would be pinning an artefact of the harness. Those belong to the
 * browser probe, on the complete pipeline.
 *
 * What survives the missing planter is what the animator alone decides:
 *
 * - the **pelvis bob**, which `prepareClip` writes and which is the whole
 *   reason a stance foot has something to stand through;
 * - the **gait tier**, which is pure clip-weight arithmetic;
 * - the **crossover**, because a pose discontinuity at the tier change would
 *   appear as joint acceleration whether or not a planter later locks a foot.
 *
 * Those three are measured on every shipped rig below, and they agree to within
 * a millimetre across all of them.
 *
 * ## Not a curve
 *
 * Every walk-lab pattern that sustains a gait long enough to fill a buffer
 * rides `CIRCLE_R = 2.6`, which at run speed is 6 m/s^2 of lateral acceleration
 * -- enough to move the pelvis off the support foot on its own. This travels in
 * a straight line, which is the only way to tell a weight-transfer defect from
 * the turn the character was asked to hold.
 *
 * `setActiveState` is not called, so weights take the legacy path. For steady
 * locomotion the two are equivalent: the state path multiplies the same
 * `targetDirWeights` by 1 while WALKING. `LocomotionState` is not exported from
 * the package, and reaching past that to exercise a multiply-by-one would buy
 * nothing.
