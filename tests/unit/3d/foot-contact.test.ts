/**
 * Foot contact
 *
 * A foot bearing weight is not necessarily a foot whose ankle is near the
 * floor. Sprinting, dancing, wearing a heel, or landing on a hill all put the
 * whole body over the ball of the foot with the ankle at rest height, and the
 * probe used to test the ankle alone against a floor pooled from both ankles.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. `ch07` running a circle at 3.9 m/s registered
 * zero right-foot contacts across sixty-two seconds -- its right foot lands
 * forefoot-first and its ankle sits 14.5cm up, three times the 4.5cm band --
 * while its toe was two and a half centimetres off the floor the whole time.
 * Nine downstream rows went red (cadence 83 against a 155-185 band, step
 * length 0.0cm, duty factor 0.15) for a reason that had nothing to do with the
 * gait, which is worse than reporting nothing: it sends the next person to
 * debug a limp that is not there.
 *
 * The fixtures below are hand-built rather than driven, so they hold the one
 * property under test still. The driven suites cannot: at 3.9 m/s the run
 * clip's own ground contact lands within a few milliseconds of
 * `minStanceDuration`, so a rig's stance count there moves for reasons that
 * have nothing to do with which joint is being measured.
