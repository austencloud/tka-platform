/**
 * The proportion sweep is only useful if each body really does move exactly one
 * dimension. A fixture that claims to be "arms long" but also widened the
 * shoulders reintroduces the very confound the sweep exists to remove, and it
 * does so silently: the lab would still render, still measure, and still
 * mislead.
 *
 * The generator enforces this at build time, but the GLBs are gitignored, so a
 * checkout cannot re-derive it. These assertions run against the committed
 * measurements instead, which is what any consumer actually reads.
 *
 * If this fails, regenerate the sweep — do not loosen the tolerances.
