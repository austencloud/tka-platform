/**
 * Locomotion harness
 *
 * Loading a rig and a clip pack under jsdom is where this suite spends its
 * landmines, and there are two worth naming because both fail quietly: a GLB
 * sliced out of a pooled Node Buffer parses as garbage and reports an
 * unsupported asset version, and a textured GLB hangs the parse forever
 * because jsdom cannot decode an image and three waits for one. The plumbing
 * below solves both, once, for every suite that needs a posed skeleton.
 *
 * `driveRig` runs the animation pipeline the way `Avatar3D` does, including
 * the option to run `FootPlanter` after the animator. That option is the whole
 * reason this file exists. Foot IK is where a leg is finally posed, so a
 * harness that stops at the animator cannot see an IK defect at all, which is
 * how a knee bending 84 degrees off sagittal reached a screenshot with the
 * gait suite green.
