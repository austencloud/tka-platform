/**
 * Static contract: /composer opens its hero on the baked fixture.
 *
 * `createHeroAct` renders nothing until its first sequence exists, and the
 * first LIVE draw is a cold generation — measured at 14.1 s on the dev server.
 * Seeding the act with FALLBACK_DEMO puts a real 16-count LOOP on screen
 * immediately; the act's own prefetch swaps in the live draw at the next loop
 * boundary. HomeHero has always done this. /composer briefly did not
 * (5d637dc105), and the page sat on "Preparing a live sequence..." for the
 * whole cold roll.
 *
 * If this fails, restore the seed — do not loosen the assertion.
