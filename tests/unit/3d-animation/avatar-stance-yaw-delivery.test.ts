/**
 * The stance blade is one open-loop pass: it measures the yaw the pose already
 * carries and turns the spine by the remainder. The remainder is a delta, and
 * it used to be bounded by `MAX_STANCE_YAW`, whose own doc comment calls it the
 * stance yaw *input* clamp. Those are different quantities.
 *
 * SpineTwister runs before the blade and on several catalog rigs turns the
 * chest the opposite way from the request, so the blade starts from roughly
 * -20 degrees while the planner asks for +87. The delta it needs is 107, the
 * clamp handed back 90, and the frame rendered 70 - Austen's "he has not turned
 * his torso to be 90 degrees all the way". Measured on main at 4a55798fb8:
 *
 *   rig    requested  pre-blade chest  delta needed  delta applied  rendered
 *   ch18       -87          +20.37        -107.37         -90        -69.70
 *   ch01       -87          +20.20        -107.20         -90        -69.64

 *
 * The shortfall is exactly `|delta needed| - 90` wherever the clamp bit, and
 * zero everywhere it did not - a saturation, not a per-rig deficit. ch07 and
 * intake never tripped it, which is why the control rig always looked correct.
