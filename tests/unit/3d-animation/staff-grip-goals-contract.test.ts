/**
 * The staff-grip lab's goal list is the swept corpus, provably.
 *
 * The lab pins the 19 core TnD sequences and shows each one's result from
 * `docs/diagnostics/prop-continuity-findings.json`. That claim only holds while
 * three things stay in step:
 *
 *   1. the roster in `lab-goals.ts`,
 *   2. `TND_MOTIONS` ids 1-19 in `scripts/seed-tnd-deck.ts`, which the sweep
 *      builds its corpus from, and
 *   3. the baked `static/data/hero/tnd-base-words.json` the browser hydrates.
 *
 * If any of them drifts, the lab would show one sequence's findings while
 * playing another's choreography. These assertions fail first instead.
