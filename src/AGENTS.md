# Source Code Contract

This file applies under `src/`. The current user request and root `AGENTS.md`
remain higher priority.

- Search by behavior and user-facing meaning before creating a component,
  service, utility, state owner, renderer, or interaction. Reuse, extend, or
  compose the existing owner when one exists.
- Stateless transforms are plain modules. Stateful lifecycle, caching, or
  coordination belongs to a named service owner. Do not add barrel exports.
- Svelte code uses Svelte 5 runes and the repository's existing context/state
  patterns. Read `.agents/skills/code-style/SKILL.md` for TypeScript or Svelte
  implementation and `.agents/skills/state-management/SKILL.md` for shared
  reactive state.
- UI changes consume the existing design system. Do not introduce a second
  primitive, token family, motion system, or layout shell for an owned behavior.
- Classify dynamic geometry: prevent accidental movement by reserving space;
  animate intentional structural change through shared motion owners. Pointer
  dragging follows the pointer and reduced motion reaches the final state
  immediately.
- Test silent behavior, not implementation prose or obvious rendering. Read
  `.agents/skills/testing/SKILL.md` before adding or changing tests.
- Inspect visual output only when the change affects appearance. New surfaces
  and responsive recomposition use the full viewport matrix; local visual fixes
  use the affected tiers and both state endpoints.
