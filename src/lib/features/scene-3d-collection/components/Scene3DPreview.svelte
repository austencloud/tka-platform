<!--
  Scene3DPreview.svelte — a live, in-page reproduction of a saved 3D scene.

  The 3D counterpart to TunnelDetailPreview: mounts the real Viewer3DCanvas with
  a fully per-instance seam, so a gallery can show several saved scenes at once
  without any of them touching the user's app.

  How the isolation works — all three contexts are local, none are global:

  - viewer-3d: built with `createViewer3DState(seed)`. The seed carries this
    scene's camera, performers, props, effect toggles, environment and scene
    features, and a seeded state writes NOTHING back (see the seed docs in
    viewer-3d-state). This is why there is no captureSettingsCheckpoint here and
    no Undo toast: applying a look destroys settings and must be undoable;
    previewing one changes nothing, so there is nothing to undo.
  - effects config: `persist: false`, so it can't read or write the shared
    tka_effects_config key.
  - scene render + scene features: fresh per mount; features come from the seed.

  The camera orbits on its own (`autoOrbit`), because a tile is watched, not
  driven. That is OrbitControls' continuous autoRotate — deliberately not the
  `auto-orbit` camera preset, which is a choreography shot tied to sequence
  duration and would never move on a scene saved without a performance.
