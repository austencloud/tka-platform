 * from inside a live viewer it would appear to do nothing until a reload. This
 * pairs it with a push into the live state so the scene repaints now AND a
 * refresh keeps it.
 *
 * The toast lives here rather than at the call site because the Undo has to
 * reach both halves: the settings checkpoint `applyScene3DLook` captured, and
 * the live viewer state, which no checkpoint knows about. The collection
 * module's own "Apply look" action keeps its call-site toast — that path has
 * no mounted viewer to restore.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION — scene-feature toggles do not apply live. `createSceneFeatureState`
 * reads `tka-scene-features` exactly once at construct, and `Viewer3DCanvas`
 * builds it once per mount (`const`, not derived), so the seed
 * `applyScene3DLook` writes only takes effect on the next mount. Its public
 * surface offers no setter that could bridge the gap: `toggle` inverts the
 * live (already stale) value rather than driving to an absolute target, so it
 * cannot express "make this key match the preset". A live apply therefore
 * swaps the environment immediately while its saved feature toggles (ocean
 * flora, torches, …) stay as they are until reload.
