/**
 * The living population of Flow Fest.
 *
 * A schedule-driven skeleton with utility-scored interrupts. Each person holds
 * a persistent identity, a home camp, and a plan for the day; the plan keeps
 * running whether or not the player is watching. Interrupts let someone stop to
 * watch a spinner or fall into a conversation without abandoning where they
 * were headed.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of the sim clock plus a seed. No
 * `Date.now()`, no wall-clock sampling: replaying the same tick sequence
 * reproduces the same festival.
 *
 * Movement is delegated to `flow-fest-corridor-graph`, which only ever routes
 * along registered person legs and registered zone envelopes. This module never
 * authors a coordinate of its own: the spots people settle on and stroll to are
 * seeded draws inside a registered envelope, checked against the same coverage
 * the routes are.
