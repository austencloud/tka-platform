 * Creators Routing
 *
 * Self-contained list<->profile routing for the Creators module. The panel
 * owns its URL/history sync so profile links survive refresh and browser
 * Back/Forward without a second host coordinating its state.
 *
 * Creator profiles use /creators/[userId]. The navigation coordinator rewrites
 * both older homes, /browse/creators/[userId] and
 * /social/creators/[userId], before the panel mounts.
 *
 * The panel drives exactly one state singleton (creatorsViewState); nothing in
 * Browse touches it anymore, so there is no second host to fight the URL.
