<!--
  RosterBand — one group of the roster, at one density.

  The band does NOT decide its own geometry. Column count and cell width are
  computed once for every band together in CreatorsPanel, because a band cannot
  see its siblings and the two facts that make the page look composed are
  cross-band: every band shares one cell size, and the busiest band fills the
  row exactly so the rest can centre against the same edges. When each band
  sized itself, three of them landed at three different widths with three
  different insets under a full-width wall.

  A group with a null `heading` is not a recency band at all — it is a filtered
  view or a search result set. It renders as a plain grid with no header, and
  its recency rings come from each person's own last-active date rather than
  from the group.

  The header is deliberately not sticky. The page has a bottom and should feel
  finite; a stack of accumulating sticky headers on a 56-person directory
  reads as "there is more of this than there is."
