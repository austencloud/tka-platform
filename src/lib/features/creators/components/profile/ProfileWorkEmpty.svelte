  What fills the work column when there is nothing in it.

  The first attempt at an empty profile dropped the column entirely and centred
  the identity rail as a lone card. Austen (2026-07-29): "I'm not really a fan in
  general of how we made it so that when somebody doesn't have content it just
  loads the single vertical strip of their regular information we could have a
  giant empty area on the right and encourage them to create content with action
  buttons."

  So the layout no longer changes shape at all — two columns for everyone — and
  this panel is what the second column holds. On your own profile it is the
  invitation. On someone else's it says plainly that they have not published
  anything, and offers the gallery instead of a dead end.

  Built on PanelState + PanelButton, which is the pattern this feature already
  uses for its error state a few lines up in UserProfilePanel.
