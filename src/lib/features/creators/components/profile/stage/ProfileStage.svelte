<!--
  Profile Stage

  The three bands that replace the profile's single wall of choreo cards:
  Showcase (a few, big, one per medium), Collections (everything saved, mixed
  and filterable), Archive (the whole library, small).

  Each artifact renders in ITS OWN medium — a sequence animates, a 3D scene
  loads the real Viewer3DCanvas, a mandala draws from its steps — rather than
  every one of them flattening into the same card front. ArtifactTile owns that;
  LiveSlots budgets how many may animate at once so a 505-item library does not
  try to run 505 render loops.

  Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-profile-as-stage-design.md
  Proven in the harness at /test/profile-stage, which now renders this same
  component so the two cannot drift.

    Tiers measured in `em`, not `px`.

    Px thresholds against a panel that carries a type ramp produce MORE, THINNER
    tiles as the screen grows — the failure 4k-native-layout.md names in rule 2.
    Concretely: the archive got 5 columns of 233px at 1920 and 7 columns of 253px
    at a real 3840, so the art never grew while the type around it did.

    Dividing the band's width by the ramped root size makes the tier ramp-aware:
    the stage measures ~80em at 1920 and ~84em at 3840, so it stays in the same
    tier and each tile grows with the ramp instead of the count growing. The
    higher tiers still exist for a stage with no rail beside it (the harness at
    /test/profile-stage runs full width).

    The two low boundaries are 40em and 26em rather than a straight px-to-em
    translation of the old 700/1100. Those numbers were compared against the
    VIEWPORT; the stage is always narrower — panel padding, the sidebar, and now
    the rail. Translating 700px to 44em put the 820px tablet at 43.4em, one hair
    under, and dropped its archive from four tiles to two.
