/**
 * The exhibit console: what a visitor is allowed to change about one performer,
 * and what that change means.
 *
 * ONE CONSOLE PER PERFORMER, and the reason is structural rather than
 * preference: the hand-swap verb only exists on a hybrid. A performer whose
 * hands are both doing the same thing has no roles to swap, so a single wing
 * console would have to grey out a button two thirds of the time and pretend
 * the three cases are more alike than they are. The contextual button's absence
 * is itself the lesson.
 *
 * THE ERA GATE. A console may offer any verb the museum can honestly
 * demonstrate, but a verb that CHANGES THE CHOREOGRAPHY is limited to concepts
 * the era on display actually had. Turn values do not exist in the Cave's era,
 * so no turn control appears here — the pedestal belongs to the era, the
 * console belongs to the museum. This is why the set can legitimately grow
 * richer in later halls: the visitor's agency expands as history expands.
 *
