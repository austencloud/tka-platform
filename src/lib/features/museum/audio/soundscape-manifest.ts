/**
 * Museum Wing Soundscape Manifest - Candidate Pools
 *
 * Each wing has a POOL of candidate ambient tracks. Inside the museum, the
 * user opens the audition bubble (bottom-left) to play through candidates
 * and pick the one they want to hear in each room.
 *
 * Two sources fill the pool:
 *   1. Curated entries in this file (hand-picked, below)
 *   2. Auto-fetched entries in ./soundscape-candidates.generated.ts
 *      (produced by `node scripts/search-soundscapes.cjs`)
 *
 * Audio files live in `static/audio/soundscapes/<wingId>/<candidate.file>`.
 * They are NOT in the repo - download them with `node scripts/fetch-soundscapes.cjs`.
 *
 * Licensing: only CC0 or CC-BY-4.0. No NonCommercial, no ShareAlike-copyleft.
