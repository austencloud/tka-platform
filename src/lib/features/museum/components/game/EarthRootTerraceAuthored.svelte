  /**
   * The Earth wing as the museum walks it: the authored Root Terrace shell plus
   * everything the museum puts INTO it at runtime.
   *
   * The GLB (`static/models/museum/cave/earth-root-terrace.glb`) is the
   * finished cave - carved from the same digest-stamped plan physics reads,
   * remeshed, textured and baked in Blender by
   * scripts/build-earth-root-terrace-production.py. It carries the rock in two
   * pieces under their own lightmaps (the walked route, and the pit the route
   * looks down into), the brass rail and its lanterns, the cut-stone case
   * letters and the wing stamp, the roots that come through the ceiling, and
   * the disc of sky at the top of the aven.
   *
   * The wing's verb is COMPARE and its barrier is ELEVATION. Everything below
   * follows from that: the three cases stand on the rootbed five metres under
   * the walking line, the visitor never descends to them, and the payoff is the
   * sightline from the landing where the row of three nests away down one axis
   * and unison reads as a single shape. So:
   *
   *   pedestals   the museum-wide standard riser under each case, and one at
   *               the vestibule opener drawing the hand path alone.
   *   performers  three automatons on the bed, one at the opener, all facing
   *               the terrace the visitor walks.
   *   lights      four pooled point lights through the room light plan - the
   *               shaft over the middle case, two lanterns on the rail, and the
   *               green seam at the Fire door. The pool keeps the nearest three.
   *
   * The GLB is authored about the earth room's plan centre, so it mounts at that
   * centre and nothing else moves. Museum3DScene's generic performer loop skips
   * the Earth stations because this file owns them.
