   * The Fire wing as the museum walks it: the authored Cinder Court shell plus
   * everything the museum puts INTO it at runtime.
   *
   * The GLB (`static/models/museum/cave/first-fire-cinder-court.glb`) is the
   * finished cave - carved from the same digest-stamped plan physics reads,
   * remeshed, textured and baked in Blender by
   * scripts/build-first-fire-production.py. It carries the rock (one piece per
   * court plus the lane, each under its own lightmap), the three court stones,
   * the trench rings, the torch stems, the coal-memory guides, the water
   * threshold slab and the green growth path to the Earth door. It carries no
   * light of its own: every photon in the Cinder Court comes from something
   * that is burning, which is what lets the extinguish beat take the room to
   * black.
   *
   *   flames      the instanced shader flames on the sixty authored guides.
   *   the state   the procession (dj -> ek -> fl -> blackout -> growth), read
   *               off the visitor's position by the same review owner the
   *               test route uses. It scales each court's BAKED light: a court
   *               burns at full lightmap, banks to coals once the visitor has
   *               walked out of it, and is dark until its turn comes.
   *   lights      three pooled point lights through the room light plan - the
   *               burning court's hero, the water threshold, the growth reveal.
   *   performers  one automaton per court, standing on the court stone and
   *               dancing while its court burns.
   *
   * The GLB is authored about the fire room's plan centre, so it mounts at that
   * centre and nothing else moves. Museum3DScene's generic performer loop skips
   * the three Fire stations because this file owns them.
