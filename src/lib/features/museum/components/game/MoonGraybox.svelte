   *
   * Two things carry the room, and both are the Sun's opposite:
   *
   * ONE HARD LIGHT. A single white directional key, fixed — it does not track
   * the visitor, because the Sun room's whole mechanism was a sun the visitor
   * drives and this room is what that mechanism is not. Fill is nearly zero, so
   * shadows go to near-black. That is the physical difference between standing
   * in air and standing in vacuum, and it is what makes the two rooms read as
   * opposites at a glance rather than as the same room in a different colour.
   *
   * A HOLE IN THE FLOOR. The plain is a ShapeGeometry with a real hole punched
   * in it at the arrival, not a disc with a dark decal — so the shaft below is
   * genuinely seen through it, and the Sun's plinth genuinely sits inside it
   * with a gap all the way round. The visitor arrives by coming UP through it.
   *
   * Nothing here spirals. Sun is quarter-time / same-direction and therefore
   * four-fold chiral; Moon is quarter-time / opposite-direction and therefore
   * four-fold MIRRORED. The plan reflects about the arrival axis and holds
   * still.

         cosmic scene in `shared/3d/environments/scenes/cosmic` already IS a
         lunar surface — Earth hanging in the sky, a starfield, nebula and
         meteor streaks, all driven off `createDefaultCosmicNightConfig()`. The
         first version of this room drew an empty black hemisphere and called
         it the Moon while that scene sat one directory away. Austen:
         *"Look at my scenes package. Find cosmic. That's the moon."*

         Only the SKY is borrowed. The ground, the mounds and the arrival hole
         stay with this module, because they carry the room's geometry contract
         and the cosmic scene's own floor is a performance stage. -->
