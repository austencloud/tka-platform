<!--
  One performer pedestal: body, lip, and the generated figure lit on the top
  face.

  The face is sunk behind the lip on purpose. A visitor standing on the floor
  reads a pedestal top at a shallow angle, and a flat plate at that angle
  catches the room's glare instead of the drawing. Sunk into a shadowed well and
  lit from inside it, the figure reads from the walking line.

  `animated` is the open experiment (spec E1): a light runs the circuit of the
  figure so the base appears to be performing the same drawing as the props
  above it. Recommended ON at the wing opener, where no performer competes with
  it, and OFF under the three cases until we have looked at both.

       This is the one surface in the object that refuses the room. Each Water
       alcove hangs a warm lamp 1.4 m directly above its pedestal, and a lit
       floor — even at a near-black albedo — resolves to mid-tan under that much
       irradiance, which washes the figure off it. Unlit, the well is the same
       dark box under a cave lamp, a forge, or daylight, so the readout reads

       wing's light: the pedestal belongs to the era, the readout belongs to
