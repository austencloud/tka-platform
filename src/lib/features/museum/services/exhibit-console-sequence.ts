/**
 * What a performer is actually doing once a visitor has pressed some buttons.
 *
 * The console does not own transform maths. Reversing a sequence and swapping
 * which hand plays which role are capabilities the app already owns, in
 * `shared/create/services/sequence-transformer`, and they are subtle: a full
 * reversal reverses step order, rewinds each step, and derives a new start
 * position from the old final end, all while pro stays pro and anti stays anti.
 * A museum-local reimplementation of that would be a second owner of the same
 * behaviour, and the one in the museum would be the one nobody maintains.
 *
 * So this module is an adapter and nothing else: museum sequence in, canonical
 * transform, steps out.
 *
 * A NOTE ON REVERSAL. "Reversal" is a specific TKA concept — hand, prop, or
 * full, marked by coloured dots on a pictograph's left edge. The console's
 * button is a FULL reversal: everything rewinds. Do not label it "reversal" in
 * copy; the verb is "reverse the hand path".
 *
