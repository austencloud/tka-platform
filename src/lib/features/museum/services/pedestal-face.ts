/**
 * The pedestal's top face: the generated figure of the sequence performed above
 * it, rendered as a texture-ready SVG.
 *
 * GENERATED, NEVER DRAWN. The Earth Long Terrace Gate 1 review (2026-08-08,
 * findings I4 and I11) caught a hand-drawn board showing letter G as two rings
 * side by side, when both of G's hands are at beta — the props are co-located
 * and their traces are concentric, not adjacent. The board drew the two props
 * in different places in a room whose whole subject is that they are in the
 * same place. A drawn motif can lie about the domain; one computed from the
 * bound sequence cannot. That review's own remediation was to generate the
 * trace from the prop-tip path, and this module is where the museum does it.
