/**
 * The Sundial — Vulcan Cave sun bay.
 *
 * Same contract as the water, fire, earth and air bays: pure geometry that,
 * given the compiled cave grid, derives world-space elevation zones, blocked
 * regions and EVERY shape the graybox renders. The physics provider consumes
 * elevationAt/blockedAt; the graybox reads the same lists and the same polar
 * helpers. One geometry source — a shape the graybox draws that this module
 * does not know about is a bug by construction.
 *
 * ── What makes this room different from the other four ──────────────────────
 *
 * The other bays are rectangles. This one is polar, and the polar frame is not
 * decoration: the visitor's BEARING from the chamber centre is the sun's
 * azimuth and their DISTANCE from it is the sun's elevation, so walking inward
 * walks the day to noon. The sun sits on the visitor's own bearing — at their
 * back — which makes every shadow in the room, the four performers' and their
 * own, run parallel with theirs. The spiral crossing is the only way in, and it
 * sweeps exactly 90° while it winds from r=9 to r=4, so the walk to zenith
 * performs Quarter-Same's own phase offset with the visitor's body.
 *
 * ── Why the chamber centre is not the room centre ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The northern SUN_CRACK_RUN_M of the interior is the rising light crack, so
 * the ⌀24 m chamber occupies the southern 24 m and its centre sits 5 m south of
 * the bay's own centre. Every polar quantity in this file is measured about
 * THAT centre. The floor plan places its four performers from the same two
 * exported helpers below, so the pillars and the sun mapping can never end up
 * on different axes.
 *
 * There is not one absolute world coordinate in this file: every offset is
 * metres measured from a compiled room bound or a real door tile span.

 * ── Why the room climbs ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It did not, at first. The crossing ran from −0.4 to −0.2 — a 0.19 m rise
 * across its whole length, which is to say flat — because the design made
 * DISTANCE from the centre carry the sun's elevation and deliberately refused
 * a literal stair, on the grounds that climbing costs zenith and repeats Air's
 * vertical axis one room later. Austen walked it (2026-08-05): *"I don't
 * really get the staircase effect it's not really going up like a spiral
 * staircase"*, and of the eye, *"way too low and I should have to work for
 * [it] by climbing around a spiral staircase."*
 *
 * So the crossing is a helix now. It still sweeps exactly 90°, because that
 * sweep IS the room's subject — the walk performs Quarter-Same's own phase
 * offset with the visitor's body — but it climbs 6.4 m while it does it, at
 * roughly the pitch of a real spiral stair.
 *
 * The climb pays for itself twice. The first graybox failed its own gate: from
 * a centre disc at −0.2 the prop shadows landed on the ring floor at −4.0, at
 * the bottom of a pit, behind the pillars, invisible from the one spot the
 * thesis needed them visible. From a summit at +6.0 the visitor looks DOWN ten
