/**
 * The Air chimney — Vulcan Cave air bay.
 *
 * Same contract as the fire and water bays: pure geometry that, given the
 * compiled cave grid, derives world-space elevation zones, blocked regions and
 * EVERY rect the graybox renders for the air bay. The physics provider consumes
 * elevationAt/blockedAt/updraftAt; the graybox reads the same rect lists. One
 * geometry source — a rect the graybox draws that this module does not know
 * about is a bug by construction.
 *
 * ── Why this is not the prototype's plan ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The feel-prototype built Plan B literally: an 18 m ramp climbing to +4.6,
 * then a lift for the last 3.8 m. Walking it killed the idea. Austen,
 * 2026-08-05: *"why would I go up the ramp to get to the airlift — the airlift
 * is demonstrating me how I can lift."* He is right, and the error was in the
 * concept, not the code. Air is the one room whose element moves the visitor,
 * so the lift cannot be the dessert at the end of a climb — it has to BE the
 * way you get around. A ramp doing four fifths of the work says the opposite.
 *
 * So: there is no ramp. The floor is open, the shaft is the room, and every
 * metre of vertical travel is air. You walk into the rise column and it takes
 * you up past three performers at eye level; you walk into the sink column and
 * it sets you down. Air lifts, air lowers, feet do the flat.
 *
 * The prototype's other scars are gone too. The head-height rock rims existed
 * only because `elevationAt` was 2D and the physics clamp treated its answer as
 * a minimum, so anyone walking under a ledge was teleported on top of it; the
 * rims were fences hiding that bug, and they were also the "big wall" standing
 * between the door and the room. `elevationAt` now takes the player's foot
 * height and returns the surface they could actually be standing on, so ledges
 * simply have space underneath and this module blocks NOTHING. The three
 * height-marker posts are gone as well — they were scaffolding to read the rise
 * against, and they read as meaningless pillars in a finished room.
 *
 * There is not one absolute world coordinate in this file: every offset is
 * metres measured from a compiled room bound or a real door tile span.
