/**
 * The Archive's audio guide — the first voice.
 *
 * DRAFT. Every line in this file is in-fiction text written for Austen's pass
 * (2026-09-04). Nothing here is final copy.
 *
 * The building's PA plays the recorded tour when the visitor enters a room
 * or walks up to certain exhibits. The tape is K, recorded 1989–1993 as the
 * Archive's narrator: over-prepared and reverent in 1989, looser with asides
 * by 1991, tighter and professional by 1993. The tape ends in the Crumble,
 * where the building did. From K's Gallery on, a second tape plays — the
 * curator's, recorded 2009, the same person fifteen years later.
 *
 * Elements are never spoken. The clinical TnD labels are stamped on the
 * threshold line under the room name instead (`roomStamp`).
