 * names. This scales with the number of public
 * collections, not the user count. A Firestore listener keeps this singleton
 * current when another device creates, renames, publishes, or edits one.
 *
 * A public collection with its owner attached — the card needs a name to
 * credit, and opening one read-only needs the owner's uid to find it.
