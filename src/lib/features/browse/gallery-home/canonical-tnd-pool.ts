/**
 * Canonical T&D pool — the defined Timing & Direction alphabet as FIRST-CLASS

 * 7x7 blue|red turn combinations becomes a normal SequenceData in the browse
 * pool: searchable, filterable, sortable, and word-collapsed by the grid into
 * one card whose variation picker holds the 49 turn combos — exactly like any
 * community word with saved variations. No special container, no special modal.
 *
 * Born 2022-03-27 (when the system came to Austen). Level comes from the
 * canonical difficulty calculator reading each combo's real steps — NOT a
 * blanket rule. A hardcoded "turned = level 2" shipped level-3 combos (half
 * turns end non-radial) wearing stored level 2, so the drill's Level 2 fan
 * card was fronted by a sequence whose printed badge said 3.
