/**
 * The collection list the filter workspace's Collections category offers.
 *
 * Your own collections first, then every public community one, deduped by id
 * and ordered by size. Shared by the gallery and the Library so the same
 * category appears in both — collections are a stackable FILTER in either
 * source, while the Library tab stays the management home (create, edit
 * membership, share).
 *
 * Call inside a `$derived.by` — it reads reactive state, so the result tracks
 * membership changes for free.
