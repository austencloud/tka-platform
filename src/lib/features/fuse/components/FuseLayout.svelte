     Right, because every door onto the recipe is on the right: the Fuse recipe
     button sits at the right end of the header, and Rule — the one card that
     opens the editor rather than holding its own control — is the last card in
     the rail. A panel that answered a right-hand control by growing out of the
     opposite edge of the screen made you look away from what you just clicked.

     The track count never changes, because CSS only interpolates two track lists
     of equal length: going from two tracks to three snapped to the end value on
     frame one, which is exactly the pop this transition was written to avoid.
     So the recipe track and its seam are always present and measure 0 when the
     recipe is closed, and the gaps are spent as explicit tracks rather than as
     `column-gap` — a uniform gap cannot be collapsed for one seam alone, and a
     zero-width track with a live gap before it would inset the cards from the
     header above them. Every track is a length, so the whole list interpolates. */
