/**
 * Maps a pictograph's blue and red prop end positions onto a multi-grid topology.
 *
 * For 2-grid topologies the convention is: blue prop belongs to the first grid,
 * red prop belongs to the second grid. The mapper reads each motion's endLocation
 * (a compass point like "n", "se", etc.) and pairs it with the corresponding
 * grid ID from the topology.
 *
 * Returns null when the pictograph lacks motion data for either hand or the
 * topology doesn't have at least two grids.
