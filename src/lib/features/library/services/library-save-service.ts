/**
 * LibrarySaveService - Orchestrates saving sequences to library
 *
 * Handles the multi-step process of saving a sequence:
 * 1. Save to Dexie (instant, works offline)
 * 2. Create any new tags that don't exist
 * 3. Start Firestore sync and thumbnail work in the background
 * 4. Refresh library state
 *
 * The Dexie write in step 2 makes saving work offline. Firestore syncs
 * in the background and fails gracefully if the user is offline - the
 * sequence is already safe in local storage.
