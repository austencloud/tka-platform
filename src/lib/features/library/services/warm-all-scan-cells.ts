/**
 * Admin warm pass for the canonical scan-card cell store.

 * Drives warmSequenceCells over every durable shortcode, including private,

 * hydrated through the same path as /q, then warmed with its exact per-hand
 * props in both supported card themes.
 *
 * Idempotent: renderCell probes the cloud store per cell and only renders +
 * uploads misses (including the IDB-hit upload backfill), so re-runs are
 * cheap. Cancellation takes effect between sequences.
