 * Svelte components (brand, url, difficulty badge, loop icons) and loads fonts —
 * ~340 ms on the main thread. Cached per theme/level/icon in
 * card-back-bitmaps-constant.ts, so cards 2..N are ~3 ms. Running one throwaway
 * buildBackJob during the pre-warm window (deck-open → review) relocates that
 * freeze off the first visible card render, mirroring the front pool seed.
