/**
 * Reversal Transform Apply (firebase-free)

 * The pure transform half of the reversal seed service: clone + flip a base

 * absolute-target apply (`applyReversalMatrix`) with its `solveHandFlips` solver.
 * Split out of `reversal-seed-service.ts` so the deck variation engine and the
 * firebase-free landing hero pool can import these without pulling the Firestore
 * seeder (and its `$lib/shared/auth/firebase` side effects) into their bundle.
 *
 * `reversal-seed-service.ts` re-exports everything here for backward compatibility.

 * inert. The first spinning step's cell is honoured on a loop via the wrap (when
 * the hand reverses an even number of times the loop closes and the wrap
 * reversal falls out automatically); on a non-loop it has no predecessor and is
 * inert, exactly as the detector reports.
