 * never touched here, so the rail's Performer tool keeps working exactly as it
 * does on every other 3D surface. Document edits — how many performers there
 * are, which sequence each one holds, where they stand at this count — are the
 * choreography's, and this module is how they reach the rigs.

 * document's own history owns "the cast changed", and a second entry from the
 * scene undo manager would make one edit take two presses of Ctrl+Z.
