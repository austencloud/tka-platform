 * The visible turn is produced by the authored turn clip (the hips bone carries
 * the body rotation; the legs step). The rig root stays CONSTANT during a clip;
 * at every clip switch the root yaw is adjusted by
 * `(visibleYaw_before - visibleYaw_after)` so the body's world yaw is continuous
 * across the seam. This banks each clip's authored rotation into the root, so
 * when the turn clip hands off to idle (whose hips return to neutral) there is
 * no discontinuity — the rotation already lives in the root.
 *
 * Visible facing is read from the HIPS bone's WORLD matrix (atan2 of the world
 * Z basis), which is robust; the package RootMotionExtractor derives yaw from a
 * single Euler component and is unreliable for large turn clips (measured 24°
 * for a 90° clip), so it is not used for rotation here.
 *
 * Arbitrary angles fall out for free: a partial target consumes only part of a
 * turn clip then settles; a target beyond one clip re-triggers the turn clip
 * (seam-matched, no pop) until the target is reached. The settle switch lands
 * the body EXACTLY on the requested facing.
 *
 * Depends only on the {@link RigBinding} interface plus the inertialization
 * unit, so any rig provider can drive it.
