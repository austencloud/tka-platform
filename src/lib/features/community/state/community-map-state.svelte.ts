/**
 * Reactive owner of the community map band: the public marker list, the signed-in
 * user's own membership, and the invitation slot derived from both.
 *
 * Ordering, supersession, session cancellation, and serialization are NOT here.
 * They live in `domain/location-mutation-queue.ts` as plain functions, because
 * that is where every defect four review rounds found actually was, and testing
 * them through a reactive wrapper would have hidden all of them. This module
 * owns reactive fields and delegates.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything below:
 *
 * 1. **Membership derives only from the user's own document.** It cannot be
 *    read off the public list: that query excludes private documents, drops
 *    documents whose profile join returns null, and is limit-bounded, so a
 *    member can be missing from it for three unrelated reasons.
 * 2. **Confirmed and optimistic state are separate.** Confirmed advances only
 *    on an applied write or a repository read. A failure drops the optimistic
 *    layer and renders confirmed — never an earlier optimistic snapshot, which
 *    would show the user a city that was never persisted.
