/**
 * The Cloudflare edge hint as a one-tap suggestion.
 *
 * The edge names a city on every request, for free, with no permission prompt.
 * That is the whole reason this feature can offer "Practicing in Chicago?"
 * instead of a dialog: the origin's own `Permissions-Policy` header disables
 * the Geolocation API, so there is no browser position to ask for.
 *
 * What the edge supplies and what gets written are deliberately different. The
 * hint carries IP-derived `lat`/`lng`, which are more precise than the stated
 * privacy model allows. They are read to name a city and never persisted; the
 * point on the map comes from a forward geocode of the city name, at the
 * moment someone actually chooses to join.
