/**
 * Places as a data source, not as a widget.
 *
 * `AutocompleteSuggestion.fetchAutocompleteSuggestions()` returns predictions
 * as plain data, which the picker renders with TKA's own markup. The widget
 * alternative injects a Google-owned custom element into a themed, font-ramped
 * panel: no supported theming surface, contrast and focus rings that cannot be
 * proven, a touch-target floor that cannot be verified by inspecting the Svelte
 * subtree, and a prediction overlay whose geometry can escape the panel or be
 * clipped by its `overflow: hidden`. None of that applies to markup this app
 * owns.
 *
 * Session tokens group a session's keystrokes with its terminating details call
 * for billing. One token is created on the first search, sent with every
 * request, and dropped as soon as a selection issues its details call — the
 * session is over at that point, and reusing the token would silently bill the
 * next search against a closed one.
