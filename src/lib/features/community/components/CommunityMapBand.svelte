<!--
  CommunityMapBand

  The community map's front door, living inside the Creators roster as one more
  band. Everything above it in the tree is a host: this component owns the
  composition — heading, map stage, invitation slot, privacy line — and the
  height the stage occupies.

  It sizes the stage itself rather than using `GlobalUserMap`'s `size="embedded"`
  variant. That variant is a hard 260px and has three other hosts
  (`Community.svelte`, `ActiveUsersPanel`, `ScanActivityTab`); converting it
  would silently change the height of three surfaces this feature has no
  business touching. `size="full"` fills whatever box it is given, and the box
  is sized in `em` so it rides CreatorsPanel's own font ramp instead of freezing
  at 1080p proportions.
