/**
 * Orientation translation between SpiroAnim's pattern-rotation axis and the
 * transcribed TKA positions.
 *
 * The transcription (`tka-transcription.json`, captured 2026-08-09) was
 * generated when SpiroAnim's default pattern orientation was a universal -90.
 * SpiroAnim has since moved to a per-ratio default (`getDefaultVtgPatternOrientation`
 * in his `vtg/types.ts`): 0 for the odd-denominator one-cycle ratios (1:1, 1:3,
 * 1:5) and -90 for the even-denominator and two-cycle ratios (1:2, 1:4, 2:3,
 * 2:5), vtg and qtr alike. So a plain 1:3 key renders the transcription 90°
 * clockwise of its capture while a plain 1:4 key renders it as captured.
 * Verified against his own compiler on 2026-08-30: compiling cells at
 * orientation -90 reproduces the transcription's position vocabulary exactly,
 * and each +45° of orientation moves every hand one compass step clockwise
 * (n → ne → e → …). Both apps label the compass from the same screen frame —
 * the transcription's grid points came from the same `closestPoint` mapping —
 * so that clockwise convention carries over verbatim.
 *
 * Translation: rotate every transcribed position clockwise by
 * `(requested − (−90)) / 45` compass steps, where a key without an `o` token
 * requests SpiroAnim's default view for its ratio. 8stp has no orientation axis and is
 * never rotated. The rotation itself goes through the canonical
 * position ↔ hand-location owner (`grid-position-deriver`), so a 45° step that
 * lands on intercardinal points produces the real box-grid position names.
