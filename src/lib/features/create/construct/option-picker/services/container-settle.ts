 * Deciding when the option picker's first measurement is trustworthy.
 *
 * Choosing a start position expands the workspace, and StandardWorkspaceLayout
 * eases its grid columns over 450ms to do it. The picker mounts before that
 * ease has run a frame, so measuring immediately reports the panel at its
 * PRE-expansion width — wide enough to commit to the 8-column desktop grid
 * inside a panel about to be half that, which then swaps to the swipe layout
 * half a second later, moving the option the user was already reaching for.
 *
 * "Have two frames agreed?" cannot tell arrived from not-started-yet: a CSS
 * transition does not advance until a frame is produced, and preparing the
 * first batch of options keeps frames from being produced. Measured live, the
 * layout's grid-template-columns transition sat at currentTime 0 while the
 * picker opened. So ask the transition itself instead of guessing from widths.
