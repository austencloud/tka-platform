   * SequenceDrawerLauncher
   *
   * Tiny always-mounted companion to the (now lazy) SequenceDrawerHost. It owns
   * the two responsibilities that must stay live even before the export drawer's
   * heavy 297-file subtree has loaded:
   *
   *  1. `?sheet=animation` deep-link / back-forward → open the export panel.
   *     Opening flips `panelState.isExportPanelOpen`, which mounts the host via
   *     LazyMount in CreateModule.
   *  2. View-sequence redirect: when `panelState.isSequenceViewerOpen` flips true,
   *     dynamic-import the sequence-viewer navigator (135-file subtree) and open
   *     the viewer — so that subtree loads ONLY on the click, never at boot.
   *
   * Static imports here are deliberately light (context + auth + url-manager).
   * The heavy navigator + handoff are dynamic-imported inside the effect.
