/**
 * Live Pipeline Edit signal
 *
 * A single active in-flight pipeline edit, published by PipelineEditorDock on
 * every WASD/numeric keystroke and read by PipelineTraceSection to show the
 * edited tier's value live — before Save — without re-running the async arrow
 * pipeline. One edit is active at a time (one color, one tier), so a single
 * module-level rune is sufficient. Cleared on Save, tier switch, deselect, and
 * dock teardown.
