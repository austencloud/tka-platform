/**
 * The step grid's arrangement, reduced to a string.
 *
 * When this value changes, cells have moved and the grid should glide from its
 * old layout to its new one. When it does not change, whatever else happened
 * was not a recomposition.
 *
 * Cell SIZE is deliberately excluded. A live panel or window drag fires the
 * ResizeObserver every frame; animating that would make the cells lag the
 * handle they are supposed to be following. Proportional resizing tracks the
 * container instantly, and only a genuine recomposition glides: a column or row
 * count change, the timeline toggle, a membership or ordering change, the start
 * tile appearing or leaving.
