/**
 * Mirrored Rotated Inverted LOOP Executor
 *
 * Executes the mirrored-rotated-inverted LOOP (Linked Orbital Offset Pattern) by composing
 * THREE LOOP operations sequentially:
 * 1. ROTATED: Apply strict rotation with user-selected slice size (halved or quartered)
 * 2. INVERTED MIRRORED: Apply vertical mirroring + inverted transformation
 *    - Letters are flipped (inverted effect)
 *    - Motion types are flipped (PRO ↔ ANTI) (inverted effect)
 *    - Locations are mirrored vertically (mirrored effect)
 *    - **Rotation directions STAY THE SAME** (both transformations flip rotation, so they CANCEL OUT)
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * HALVED mode (16-count sequence):
 * - Generate 4 letters (16 ÷ 4)
 * - Rotation (halved) → 8 letters (4 × 2, returns to home)
 * - Inverted Mirroring → 16 letters (8 × 2, with flipped motion types and letters)
 *
 * QUARTERED mode (16-count sequence):
 * - Generate 2 letters (16 ÷ 8)
 * - Rotation (quartered) → 8 letters (2 × 4, returns to home)
 * - Inverted Mirroring → 16 letters (8 × 2, with flipped motion types and letters)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Supports both halved and quartered slice sizes
 * IMPORTANT: End position for generation must match the rotation requirement
 * IMPORTANT: After rotation, sequence returns to home, which is valid for inverted mirror
