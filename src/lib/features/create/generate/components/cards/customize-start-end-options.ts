/**
 * Build a complete, internally-consistent StartEndOptions from the overlay's
 * live local state.
 *
 * Why this exists: the overlay edits start positions, end position, and both
 * start orientations independently, but the engine's setOptions() does a full
 * REPLACE (not a merge). The overlay used to spread its frozen open-time
 * snapshot per handler (`{ ...startEndOptions, leftStartOrientation }`), so
 * each single-field change reset every field the user wasn't currently
 * touching back to its open-time value — change right and left silently reverted,
 * change a position and the orientations reverted, etc. The overlay's own
 * display read separate local mirrors that did NOT revert, so the overlay
 * showed the picked value while the card summary and the generated sequence
 * used the stale one ("wrong orientation in the panel" / "didn't take").
 *
 * Emitting the FULL local state on every edit keeps the engine state in lockstep
 * with what the overlay shows. `base` supplies only the fields the overlay does
 * not manage (mustContain/mustNotContain letters); those never change while the
 * overlay is open. startPosition is legacy/deprecated — the blocked-position
 * list supersedes it — so it is always cleared.
