/**
 * Trace Path Sampler — the ONE place trace-game geometry comes from.
 *
 * The trace game asks a player to drag a fingertip along the same route the
 * hand-path renderer already draws. If the evaluator re-derived that curve from
 * scratch we would end up grading people against a second, subtly different
 * interpretation of the grid — the line on screen and the line being scored
 * would drift apart and nobody would be able to tell why a "perfect" trace
 * scored 80%. So this module delegates to the renderer's own geometry
 * (`getPathPoints`) and only changes the coordinate space.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices worth understanding before you edit anything here:
 *
 * 1. We ALWAYS pass `overridePathType` explicitly. Without it `getPathPoints`
 *    asks `getAnimationVisibilityManager()` — a browser singleton holding the
 *    user's display preference — which hand-path shape to draw. That makes the
 *    function impure, unusable in a plain node test, and (worse) it would mean
 *    a player who flips a *display* preference silently changes the route they
 *    are being graded against. The expected route must not move when a display
 *    toggle moves, so the game pins the shape from geometry alone: opposite
 *    points are a dash (straight through center), everything else is the arc
 *    around the grid circle. "concave" (the petal path) is never used for
 *    grading — it dips toward center and would put the route where a finger
 *    cannot reasonably follow it on a small stage.
 *
 * 2. Everything leaves here in a normalized 0..1 stage space. Tolerances in
 *    this feature are stage-relative, so a phone and a 4K monitor score the
 *    same trace identically.
