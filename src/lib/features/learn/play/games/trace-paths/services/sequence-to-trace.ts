/**
 * SequenceData → TraceRound.
 *
 * Turns a real sequence into the ordered, directed routes the player draws.
 * One beat per step, in order, and the hand's own start/end locations decide
 * everything — the converter never consults pointer order, color alone, or any
 * runtime state. Hand assignment at play time comes from the zone the pointer
 * touches; here it comes from which motion slot the data lives in.
 *
 * The converter refuses rather than repairs. A sequence whose beats don't chain
 * (a hand teleports between steps) or that drops a hand mid-round is not
 * traceable, and the game shows that as an earned error with a retry.

 * Fallback chain, most authoritative first:
 *   1. `sequence.gridMode` — set by the hydrator on anything that came from the
 *      library, and the only field that describes the sequence as a whole.
 *   2. The first step's own `gridMode` — present on steps built by the step
 *      editor, absent on plenty of older data.
 *   3. The first step's blue motion `gridMode` — required on every MotionData,
 *      so this is the last field that can actually carry the answer.
 *   4. DIAMOND — the app's default grid. Reached only when a caller hands us a
 *      sequence assembled by hand with no grid information anywhere in it.
 *
 * Note we never *infer* the mode from which locations appear. That inference
 * exists (hand-path-factory's deriveGridMode) but it guesses skewed/box from
 * cardinality, and guessing the stage the player draws on is worse than
 * defaulting to the one they see everywhere else.
