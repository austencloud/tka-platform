/**
 * Shared-grid preflight — can two fingertips actually trace this round on ONE grid?
 *
 * The trace game defaults to a split grid (one grid per hand) for a physical
 * reason: TKA routes are written for two hands moving through the same space,
 * and a lot of perfectly legal sequences put both hands on the same point at
 * the same moment. Two fingertips cannot occupy one spot. Beta positions do
 * exactly that by definition, so this check fires often — that is the correct
 * outcome, not a bug to tune away.
 *
 * The one thing this function must never do is move a target off its canonical
 * grid location to make an impossible round look possible. A round that cannot
 * be traced on a shared grid gets reported as such and rendered on split grids.
 * Lying about where a point lives would teach the wrong grid.
 *
 * Timing matters: two routes that cross at DIFFERENT beats are fine, because
 * the fingers are never on the crossing at the same time. Only routes that
 * overlap WITHIN one synchronized beat are rejected, so comparisons are always
 * scoped to a single beat.
