/**
 * Trace Paths — the round's reactive state.
 *
 * This is the ONLY stateful piece of the game. It wraps the pure
 * `createTraceEvaluator` and adds the three things a pure grader can't have:
 * a phase machine the UI can render, pointer bookkeeping, and player settings.
 *
 * It deliberately reimplements NONE of the geometry, gating, or scoring — every
 * judgement call goes to the evaluator and to `scoreTraceRound`. If you find
 * yourself measuring a distance in this file, the logic belongs one layer down.
 *
 * Three rules here are load-bearing and are commented again at their call sites:
 *
 * 1. HAND IDENTITY COMES FROM PLACE, NOT FROM POINTER ORDER. Which hand a finger
 *    controls is decided by the start zone (or the per-hand grid) it lands in.
 *    Never by `pointerId` ordering, never by `isPrimary`. Two players sharing a
 *    tablet, a left-hander, and a person who happens to touch red first all get
 *    the same behaviour.
 * 2. AN INTERRUPTION IS A PAUSE, NEVER A FAILURE. `pointercancel`, a lost
 *    capture, a notification pulling the app to the background — all of them
 *    park the round with the last completed beat intact and let the player pick
 *    up where they were.
 * 3. NO RAW POINTER TRACE LEAVES THIS MODULE. The render trail is a capped,
 *    ephemeral polyline for drawing only; the outcome handed to the arcade is
 *    aggregate metrics. Nothing sample-challenge is persisted or transmitted.
