/**
 * Trace Paths — boundary types.
 *
 * A "trace round" is the thing the player is asked to draw: an ordered,
 * directed route per hand, laid out on a beat timeline. Order and direction
 * are the whole point of the game, so every shape here is a LIST, never a set
 * — a recognizer that accepts the right shape traversed in the wrong order is
 * wrong, and these types are built so that mistake can't be expressed.
 *
 * Everything spatial in this module lives in normalized stage space (0..1),
 * never in device pixels. The stage is a square (the pictograph's 950x950
 * coordinate space divided through by 950), so a tolerance expressed here
 * means the same fraction of the stage on a phone and on a 4K monitor.
