<!--
  Trace Paths — hub preview. Acts out the mechanic in miniature: the route
  appears on the grid, then a fingertip walks it end to end, in order.

  Both the route and the grid dots are the REAL geometry — `sampleSegmentPath`
  is the same sampler the game grades against, and the hand points come from
  the grid-coordinate SSOT. So the card can never advertise a curve or a grid
  the game doesn't actually use. Order and direction are the whole point of
  this game, so the preview draws itself start → end rather than fading a
  finished line in.

  Pure CSS motion over a static SVG path — no rAF, nothing to clean up.
