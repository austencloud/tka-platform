/**
 * Shared types for the Learn module's domain constants.
 *
 * Only types that are genuinely identical across sibling constant files live
 * here. Types that look similar but diverge in their value sets are deliberately
 * NOT consolidated (see note below), because folding them together would erase a
 * real semantic distinction.
 *
 * NOT consolidated, on purpose:
 * - `HandPosition` exists as a 4-point cardinal union (`N|E|S|W`, the staff/motion
 *   visualizers) and an 8-point union (`N|NE|E|...|NW`, the word/position quizzes).
 *   These are different coordinate domains; `motion-visualizer-data.ts` and
 *   `word-visualizer-data.ts` already disambiguate them as `HandPosition4` /
 *   `HandPosition8`.
 * - `MotionType` is `shift|dash|static` (hand-path family, in the motion files)
 *   in some files and `pro|anti|hybrid` (prop rotation) in the word files. Wholly
 *   different value sets — merging would type-check nonsense.
 * - `GridPoint` is `{x,y}` in some files and `{x,y,label}` in others. Different
 *   shapes; merging would force a `label` onto consumers that don't carry one.
