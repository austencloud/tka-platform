/**
 * Where the annotation corpus lives.
 *
 * This is a months-long labeling effort, so the storage has to be durable
 * across reloads, browser restarts and crashes, and it has to hold far more
 * than a handful of records. That rules out localStorage, whose few-megabyte
 * quota fails by throwing mid-write - exactly the moment when losing a session's
 * work hurts most. It gets its own IndexedDB database rather than a table in the
 * app-wide one, so a research instrument never forces a schema migration on
 * everybody else's sequences.
 *
 * Nothing is written to Firestore. The corpus is read constantly while
 * annotating and would be a standing unbounded-query cost for data only one
 * person uses, which `.claude/rules/firestore-cost-discipline.md` exists to
 * prevent. Export writes a file when the corpus needs to leave the machine.
