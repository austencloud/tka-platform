/**
 * Transposing a movement to the other side of the body.
 *
 * A performer who has described what the right arm does on the right side has
 * already described what the left arm does on the left side. It is the same
 * shoulder, the same elbow, the same path - reflected. Asking someone to
 * describe both is asking them to do the same work twice, which is why the
 * coverage count pairs them.
 *
 * Transposing is two canonical TKA transformations at once. Mirrored reflects
 * the grid positions across the vertical axis; Swapped exchanges the left and
 * right hands. Neither implies the other, so this module composes them rather
 * than pretending "mirror" already meant both.
 *
 * The hand swap is free here, and that is worth stating rather than leaving as
 * a surprise: `HandMotionSignature` records what ONE arm does and never which
 * arm did it. Two hands performing the same motion share a signature already.
 * So at this layer the swap has nothing to act on, and the reflection carries
 * the whole transposition. The colours still swap where a human can see them -
 * a blue observation credits the red twin - but that happens because the two
 * signatures are now one movement, not because a field was rewritten.
