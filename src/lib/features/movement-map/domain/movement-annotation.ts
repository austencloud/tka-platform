/**
 * What an observation of a body at one instant is, and what it is filed under.
 *
 * The important decision here is that an annotation is NOT identified by its
 * video timestamp. "At 4.732 seconds the thumb end passes behind the head" is a
 * fact about one clip and dies with it. "At the midpoint of a blue pro clockwise
 * motion travelling south to west, in to out, the thumb end passes behind the
 * head" is a fact about the motion itself, and it holds for every performance of
 * that motion by anyone, forever.
 *
 * So the timestamp is kept as evidence - it is how you jump back to the frame
 * that justified the call - while the motion signature plus the phase is the
 * identity. That is what turns a pile of labeled frames into a map of the finite
 * space of movements, which is the entire point of the exercise.
