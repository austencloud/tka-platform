/**
 * The finite set of arm movements that Level 1 can ask for.
 *
 * This is what makes the labeling effort bounded rather than endless. Level 1
 * holds no turns and no non-radial orientations, so once every distinct per-hand
 * movement in it has been described, that world is mapped and the next one can
 * start. The tool can only say "you are 62% of the way through Level 1" because
 * this module can say what the whole of Level 1 is.
 *
 * Nothing here is written down by hand. The movements come from the pictograph
 * dataframe that the app already renders from, and every end orientation is
 * computed by the same calculator the sequence engine uses. A hardcoded table
 * would drift the moment either changed, and would be a claim about the domain
 * rather than a reading of it.
 *
 * Level 1 is defined by `sequence-difficulty-calculator.ts`: a sequence is
 * Level 1 when no motion carries turns and no orientation is CLOCK or COUNTER.
 * Applied to a single motion, that means turns of zero and radial orientations
 * at both ends.
