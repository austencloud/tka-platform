/**
 * Which movement the body is in the middle of, and how far through it is.
 *
 * The step map marks arrivals - the instants a shape lands. That is the right
 * thing for a viewer, which wants to light up the shape currently being held.
 * It is the wrong thing here, because the anatomy worth describing happens
 * during the travel, not at the endpoint: an arm reaches behind the head
 * somewhere in the middle of a movement and is back in front by the time it
 * lands.
 *
 * So this reads the same marks the other way round. Between the arrival of move
 * k and the arrival of move k+1, the body is performing move k+1, and where the
 * playhead sits between those two marks is how far through that move it is. A
 * phase of 0 is the launch, 1 is the arrival.
 *
 * Phase 1 of one move and phase 0 of the next name the same instant, which is
 * true of the performance as well - a move's arrival is the next move's launch.
 * The phase anchors keep them distinguishable when an observation is filed.
