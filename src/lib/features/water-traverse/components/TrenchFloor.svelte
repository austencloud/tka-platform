   * The sculpted trench floor.

   * Replaces the flat `#41504e` plane the middle leg shipped with. That plane
   * is why every frame down here bottomed out in dead teal: there was nothing
   * on the ground to look at and no route through it, so 712 reef specimens
   * were being dressed onto a graybox.
   *
   * The mesh is baked from the same height field the colliders are tiled from
   * (scripts/traverse_seabed.py -> water-traverse-seabed.ts), so what the
   * visitor sees and what they stand on are the same surface by construction.
   *
   * Colour rides on the mesh as COLOR_0 — pale swept sand down the cleared
   * route, silt at the verge, dark rock up the flanks. No texture: at 138 m by
   * 84 m one would be the largest asset in the walk, and what the floor needs
   * is a gradient, not detail.
   *
   * The GLB carries absolute route coordinates for the whole sea leg, so it is
   * placed at the world origin and never offset.
