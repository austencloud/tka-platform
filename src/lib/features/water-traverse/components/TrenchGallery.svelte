   * The composed trench reef: 513 instances of 37 researched assets, spread
   * across the whole 98 m middle leg.
   *
   * This replaces the single baked ocean reef GLB the trench used to borrow.
   * That asset is composed for the ocean stage — a theatre arranged around a
   * proscenium and a hero camera — so dropping it here produced a 40 m island
   * in a 98 m room with bare sand either side of it.
   *
   * The composition is authored offline and baked, per
   * .claude/rules/blender-first-3d-scenes.md:
   *
   *   scripts/water-traverse-reef-layout.json   the art layer
   *   scripts/generate-traverse-reef.py         -> water-traverse-reef.json
   *   scripts/build-traverse-reef.py            -> trench-reef_raw.glb
   *   scripts/optimize-ocean-glb.mjs <in> <out> -> trench-reef.glb
   *
   * Placements carry ABSOLUTE route z, so this group sits at z = 0 and only
   * the seabed elevation is applied. Do not centre it on the trench.

   * Make the source assets dielectric.
   *
   * Most of the 38 specimens arrive with `metalness: 1` — a glTF default that
   * survives when the exporter writes no metallicRoughness texture. A fully
   * metallic PBR surface has NO diffuse response: it shows only the specular
   * reflection of an environment map, and this trench has no environment map.
   * The result was the largest specimens rendering as black cutouts with a pale
   * rim where the single directional light's rough specular lobe caught them.
   *
   * It also made the chamber immune to lighting work. Hemisphere light is
   * diffuse, so raising the seabed's upwelling fill changed nothing at all on
   * the surfaces that most needed it — the failure looked like a lighting bug
   * and was a material one.
   *
   * Coral, sponge, sand-rock and basalt are dielectrics. Metalness 0 is not a
   * look choice here, it is the correct value; the 1 is junk metadata. Fixed at
   * load rather than in the bake so it also covers any specimen added later
   * from the same third-party sources.
