  /**
   * Everything alive in the trench.
   *
   * The middle leg shipped as a flat teal gradient with a performer standing in
   * it: no seabed, no light, nothing moving. It is a third of the walk and it
   * was the worst third. The ocean scene already owns every part needed to fix
   * that, so none of it is rebuilt here — this module only RE-AIMS those systems
   * at a 138 m trench instead of the 30 m stage they were authored around.
   *
   * Two things make the re-aim necessary:
   *
   *  1. They are all anchored to `userProportionsState.groundY` (0) with the
   *     ocean's own water plane 12 above it. Our seabed is at -18 and our
   *     waterline is 0, so each system needs its own offset to land.
   *
   *     `worldYOffset` does NOT move them. It is a world<->local hint the
   *     components use for cursor rays and shader uniforms; the move is done
   *     by an ANCESTOR GROUP (see Environment3D.svelte:221, which translates
   *     the whole ocean and passes the same number down). Passing the prop
   *     without the group leaves every system at ocean-local y=0 — which here
   *     is the waterline, so the entire seabed rendered on the surface.
   *     Group position and prop always carry the same value.
   *  2. They are sized for a stage you stand in front of, not a corridor you
   *     walk down. One instance at the centre leaves both ends dead, so the
   *     atmosphere systems are TILED down the route.
   *
   * The root OceanScene is deliberately not used: it mutates scene.fog,
   * scene.background and scene.environment directly, which would fight the
   * traverse's own continuous atmosphere field.

   *     shoal spooks it.
   *
