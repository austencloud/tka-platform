/**
 * Shop conversion funnel — the five ordered steps, in one place.
 *
 *   shop_product_viewed → shop_variant_selected → shop_add_to_cart
 *     → shop_checkout_started → shop_purchase_completed
 *
 * add_to_cart is optional in the funnel: a BuyButton in mode="buy" goes
 * straight from variant to checkout. Build the PostHog funnel in NON-STRICT
 * order so the cart path and the direct-buy path both count.
 *
 * Everything here rides `logActivity(name, "shop", …)` — the pattern the shop
 * already runs on, and the reason the six names are registered in the
 * ActivityEventType union. logActivity remaps a fixed camelCase allowlist and
 * passes anything else through verbatim, so every property below is already
 * snake_case and lands unmodified.
 *
 * Properties are deliberately BOUNDED: closed unions and flattened LoopConfig
 * fields, never the config object, never a configKey, never an href. The one
 * sanctioned high-cardinality property is `stripe_session_id`, which exists to
 * join to Stripe for revenue reconciliation — a join key, never a breakdown.
