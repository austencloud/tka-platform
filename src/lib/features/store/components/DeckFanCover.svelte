<!--
  DeckFanCover — a fanned hand of REAL printed card fronts, rendered through
  the print pipeline (PrintCardRenderer: canonical locked visibility, MPC
  stripe frame, accent coloring), used as deck cover art in the shop grid, the
  /shop hero, and the configurators. What the fan shows IS what prints.

  Decorative by default: covers render inside links/option buttons, so the fan
  is `inert` + aria-hidden; the host element carries the accessible label.
  With `onCardClick` set, each card instead becomes a real focusable button
  (the composer promo fan → card-anatomy explainer modal).

  Hover model: the row's geometry NEVER changes — only the card under the
  pointer pops (bottom-anchored scale + z-raise). Any spread/shift moved cards
  under a stationary cursor and caused mis-hovers and mis-clicks.

  Card count responds to container width (3–6), capped by maxCards. Cards
  auto-scale UP from cardWidth to fill the container (ultrawide screens get a
  properly big fan), capped by maxCardWidth.
