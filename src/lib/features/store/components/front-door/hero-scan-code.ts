/**
 * The hero's short code, read-only.
 *
 * The phone in the hero loads the REAL `/q/<code>` for the card on screen, so
 * it needs that card's code. Two hard constraints shape how it gets one:
 *
 * 1. **Never mint.** `createShortCode` allocates and WRITES, and the scheme's
 *    whole integrity is one-code-per-hash. A public marketing page must not be
 *    a writer — a visitor loading /shop must never create Firestore documents.
 *    `findExistingCodeForSequence` is a pure read (added for exactly this):
 *    hash the sequence, query `shortcodes` by `encoderHash`, take the canonical
 *    winner, return. No allocation, and no hash-index heal either, which is why
 *    it is not the older `findExistingCodeByHash`.
 * 2. **Never block the page.** No code (unbaked card, cold catalog, offline,
 *    rules refusal) simply means no phone content. The hero renders its cards
 *    and its button stays inert rather than promising a page that isn't there.
 *
 * 3. **Never demo a page the card does not lead to.** The lookup and the baked
 *    cover are two independent sources for one card's code, and they have
 *    disagreed in production. The resolved code is checked against the code
 *    printed on the very cover being shown, and a card whose two sources
 *    disagree gets no phone at all — a wrong demo is worse than no demo.
 *
 * The manager needs a browse loader before it can be constructed, and /shop is
 * a public route that skips the app's composition root — so this configures the
 * same read-only stub `/q` uses, and only if nothing else has configured it
 * first. Codes are memoized per sequence CONTENT (never per id — see `keyFor`)
 * for the page session: dealing back to a card already seen costs nothing.
