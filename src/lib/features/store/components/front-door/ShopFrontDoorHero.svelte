<!--
  The teaching hero. Someone landing here has probably never seen a card that
  does anything, so the first screen holds up one real card and says what
  happens when you point a phone at it — then hands off to the catalog.

  The card is a real printed front pulled from the catalog, not an illustration.
  When the baked cover exists it carries the card's real, scannable QR; when it
  doesn't, the card shows without one. There is no drawn-on QR.

  It is held up with its own back beside it (HeroCardDuo), and the back's mandala
  is drawn live rather than printed. That is the claim the page makes — scan it
  and it moves — shown instead of described. The hero deals from the whole
  catalog rather than holding one card, so a second look is a different card.

  /* Two columns only once the pair of cards has room to be cards. Below this
     the duo takes the full band, which is wider than half of a tablet.

     THE COPY HUGS ITS OWN MEASURE, AND THE STAGE TAKES THE REST. An even
     1fr/1.05fr split gave the copy a column its longest line never reached:
     260px of slack at 1920 and around 700px at 3840, all of it pooled against
     the scene as one dead field. Austen (2026-08-04): "the words Choreo Cards
     are so far to the left with a big space in between the animation."

     `fit-content` sizes the column to the copy and caps it, so a long line
     can't run away with the band, and everything it doesn't use goes to the
     stage — which now has three objects to stand side by side and spends it
     (HeroCardDuo's container tiers). Same band, same grid, no second width
     system: 4k-native-layout.md's "one width per page", read the other way
     round — the gap between the two halves is capped so they stay one
     composition instead of two pages. */

    }
  }

  /* Wide but short (a folded Fold in landscape, a laptop in a small window).
     Stacked, the copy alone fills the screen and the cards never appear, which
     is the one thing this hero exists to show. Side by side they both fit. */

      gap: 2rem;
    }
    /* The copy's own trims for this tier live at the foot of this stylesheet:
       the base .copy / h1 / .steps rules are declared BELOW these media blocks,
       so an override written here loses on source order. */
  }

  /* THE FOLD. The first screen is exactly this hero plus the shelf filter, and
     the catalog's first row starts one pixel below it.

     Left alone, the hero's natural height landed the grid's top edge just
     ABOVE the fold on the two commonest desktop sizes — 61px of tile shell
     showing at 1920×1080, 155px at 2560×1440. Both are cut mid-shape with
     nothing readable in them, which is what Austen saw: "there's stuff peeking
     out from the bottom that doesn't feel right." A peek has to be earned
     (enough card art to read as an invitation) and neither was close, so the
     gap is closed instead: the hero takes the rest of the screen.

     `min-height`, so it only ever GROWS the band. On a phone, where the copy
     and the stage stack to well over a screen on their own, it is a no-op; on
     tablet portrait it closes a 27px shell edge. The min-height guard keeps it
     away from the wide-and-short tier above, whose whole job is to make the
     hero smaller.

     Above 3000px the rule stops, deliberately. At 4K@100% the leftover below
     the filter is ~655px — the tile row is ~630px there, so the first row
     lands COMPLETE. Filling the screen instead would inflate the hero by that
     same 655px of dead band, which is exactly the failure the old 60svh floor
     had here. Below 3000 the leftover is smaller than a row; above it, larger.
     That is the seam. */

  }

  /* 4K@100% and wider. The band is sized by its content — a 60svh floor on a
     2160px-tall screen inflated it ~300px past what the content needs and
     stranded the CTA in an empty field — and the card takes the room instead
     (HeroCardDuo's container tiers).

     The padding is trimmed rather than left at the base scale because up here
     it is what decides the fold: at 3840×2160 the hero, the filter and the
     catalog's first row come to within ~30px of the viewport, so a looser
     band cuts the bottom edge off a row that would otherwise land whole. */
