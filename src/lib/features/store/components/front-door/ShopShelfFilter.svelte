<!--
  The shelf switch above the catalog: All, then one chip per shelf that actually
  has products, each carrying its count.

  Exactly one shelf is showing at any moment, which is what SegmentedControl is
  for — a row of independent toggles could represent "Decks and Books at once",
  a state this filter does not have, and would lose the sliding indicator.

  It is a radiogroup, not a tablist. Tabs promise a tabpanel per tab; this is
  one grid that re-filters, which is what every other filter row in the app
  (CreatorsPanel, the smart-collections filters) uses radiogroup for.

  It sticks under the site header so the shelf you picked stays reachable while
  you scroll the grid.
