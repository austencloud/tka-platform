<!--
  The hero's phone — and the page's whole argument.

  Every previous version of this hero DESCRIBED what a scan does, or mimed it:
  a drawn mandala standing in for the sequence coming alive. It was pretty and
  it was fiction. Austen's call (2026-08-03): "on that phone it literally loads
  the exact component that they will literally see when they go to the literal
  QR code scan ... a miniature phone simulating what the phone will experience."

  So this screen is an iframe of the real `/q/<code>` for the card on the stack
  beside it — the same route the printed QR opens, the same component, the same
  loading beats. Nothing here is a mock of the viewer, and nothing here forks
  its chrome.

  THREE THINGS MAKE THAT SAFE:

  1. `?demo=1`. A page that shows the scan route must not be counted as
     scanning. The /q host reads the flag and skips PostHog init, the scan
     visit, and the physical-card ledger write, which silences every
     downstream captureScan* by construction. See QScanPage.svelte.
  2. The code is LOOKED UP, never minted. `findExistingCodeForSequence` is a
     pure Firestore read; a public marketing page must never write short codes
     (one-code-per-hash). No code, no phone — the composition just holds the
     cards.
  3. The screen is LIVE WHEN IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE USED BY THE POINTER YOU
     HAVE, and inert below that (see `bigEnough`). It used to be pointer-inert
     at every size, on the argument that it was a depiction rather than a
     control surface. Austen (2026-08-04): "on my 4K device I actually could
     click each one of these buttons very easily." Right — at 4K the embedded
     viewer's controls render LARGER than they do on a real phone, so refusing
     the click was the only dishonest thing left on an otherwise honest
     picture. Below the gate the old argument still holds and the old behavior
     is unchanged. Either way "Open this scan" stays: the real /q, no demo
     flag, new tab.
  4. The embed shows the scan, so the chrome that LEAVES the scan is not in it
     — the /q host passes `embedded` to the shared viewer shell when demo=1,
     and the shell drops close, the account entry, Share, and every
     navigate-away menu item. See SequenceViewerShell.svelte.

  The iframe renders at a true 375 CSS viewport WIDTH — a phone's width, so /q
  lays itself out exactly as it does on a phone — and is scaled into the frame
  with a transform. Its HEIGHT is derived from the measured screen so the
  embedded page's own viewport is exactly the visible screen (see `frameH`).
  Nothing loads until the first scan press.

   * It used to be a hardcoded 375x812 — an iPhone X's viewport — scaled by
   * width alone into a screen whose aspect ratio is set by the phone body
   * (1:2.02 with a 2.4% bezel, so the screen is about 1:2.07). 812/375 is
   * 2.165, which is TALLER than the box it lands in, so /q laid itself out to
   * a page ~4% longer than the visible screen and the bottom 4% fell outside
   * it. What fell outside was the viewer's bottom navigation. Austen
   * (2026-08-04): "it appears to have its bottom navigation that's cut off as
   * though the component isn't properly telling its contents how big it is."
   *
   * Exactly right, so the component tells it. Width stays 375 because that is
   * what makes /q lay out as a phone; the height is whatever, at this scale,
   * fills the screen we actually have — measured, not assumed. /q's own
   * `svh`/`dvh` rules then resolve against the iframe, and its bottom bar sits
   * on the visible bottom edge by construction, at every viewport.
   *
   * `clientWidth`/`clientHeight` are the right measures rather than a bounding
   * rect: the phone is rotated in 3D and scaled by the deal flourish, and
   * those are LAYOUT boxes, unmoved by any of it. Svelte's bindings are
   * ResizeObserver-backed, so this re-derives itself whenever the stage
   * resizes. Rounding up spends a sub-pixel of overfill (clipped by the
   * screen's `overflow: hidden`) to guarantee no sliver of backdrop can show
   * along the bottom edge.

  /**
   * THE TARGET-SIZE GATE — the number that decides whether the screen is a
   * control surface or a picture of one. There are two of them, because a
   * thumb and a mouse are not the same instrument.
   *
   * The embedded page lays itself out at 375 CSS px and is then scaled by
   * `scale`, so every control inside it is scaled too: the app's 44px floor
   * (`--min-touch-target`) lands on screen at `44 * scale`.
   *
   * The first version of this gate had ONE threshold, 0.9, derived from that
   * 44px floor — and 44px is a TOUCH norm (it is the size of a fingertip, not
   * the size of a thing a cursor can hit). Applied to a mouse it made the most
   * common real 4K setup, 4K at 200% Windows scaling = a 1920 CSS viewport,
   * inert. Austen's own machine. He pressed the nav inside the phone and
   * nothing happened: "right now when I try to click on them inside the fake
   * phone it still does not work."
   *
   * So the floor follows the pointer. For a fine pointer the governing number
   * is WCAG 2.2's Target Size (Minimum), 24 CSS px — the pointer-agnostic
   * minimum, and the one that actually describes a cursor. The embedded
   * viewer's smallest real control is a bottom-nav tab, measured 67.6 x 44.0
   * CSS px in the frame's own coordinates, so 24 / 44 = 0.545 -> 0.55.
   *
   * Measured, not assumed (2026-08-04, Chrome, one CSS px per device px; tab
   * = a bottom-nav tab's on-screen height, and it is exactly the 44px floor):
   *
   *   viewport      screen px  scale   tab lands at   fine    coarse
   *   3840 x 2160      399     1.064       46.8       live    live
   *   2560 x 1440      347     0.925       40.7       live    live
   *   1920 x 1080      255     0.680       29.9       live    inert
   *   1440 x  900      217     0.579       25.5       live    inert
   *    820 x 1180      194     0.517       22.8       inert   inert
   *    960 x  412       75     0.200        8.8       inert   inert
   *    375 x  667      110     0.293       12.9       inert   inert
   *
   * Both lines fall in empty GAPS in that ladder — 0.55 between 0.517 and
   * 0.579, 0.9 between 0.680 and 0.925 — which is what makes them stable
   * thresholds rather than lucky ones. 820 sits just under the fine line on
   * purpose: at 0.517 a tab is 22.9px, under the 24px minimum, and a real
   * 820-wide device is a tablet reporting a coarse pointer anyway.
   *
   * Coarse keeps the old rule verbatim: a visitor on a phone, tapping a phone
   * drawn inside their phone, is looking at a picture. Nothing about a real
   * touch screen makes a 13px tab hittable.
   *
   * The one thing that could chatter is a live RESIZE dragged across a line,
   * so each gate has hysteresis: it opens at its threshold and does not close
   * until slightly below. A gate that chattered would flash the cue on and off.
   *
   * Reactive off the measured screen width — the same ResizeObserver-backed
   * binding `frameH` derives from — never a viewport media query. The screen's
   * size is a function of the stage's container tiers and `svh`, not of the
   * viewport width alone, so only the measurement knows the answer. The
   * POINTER is the one thing a measurement cannot know, so that half is a
   * media query, listened to rather than sampled: a convertible folding into
   * tablet mode flips it without a resize.

     A phone is a machined object, and the flat gradient it used to be read as
     a rounded rectangle with a picture in it. Everything below is CSS — no
     device frame asset, and nothing that cosplays a particular manufacturer.
     Austen (2026-08-04): "is this the most realistic we can make the phone
     look." Four cues do it: a rim that catches light, buttons that break the
     silhouette, a camera cut into the display, and glass that has a sheen.

     THE RIM. The old edge was one flat inset hairline, the same brightness the
     whole way round, which is exactly what an edge of real metal never is. A
     conic gradient masked to the border box gives the frame a light source: it
     flares along the upper-left and lower-right chamfers and goes near-dark on
     the runs between them, so turning the phone (the lean, the entrance) reads
     as an object catching a highlight. `mask-composite: exclude` over a
     content-box mask is the standard gradient-border trick — the padding value
     IS the rim's thickness. */
