<!-- src/lib/features/store/components/ShopEntryArt.svelte -->
<!--
  The art inside any storefront art box — the catalog front door's tiles, its
  hero, and the cross-sell rail on every product page all render through this
  one component, so an entry looks the same wherever it appears: a fan of real
  printed card fronts, the printed guide's real cover, or the product's cover
  image.

  The fan and the book cover both pull in the print pipeline, which is browser
  work (canvas, workers, Firebase). /shop renders on the server for crawlers, so
  those two load through a browser-gated dynamic import and the server sends the
  text and the reserved box. The box is sized by the host, so art landing late
  moves nothing.
