/**
 * The tunnel adapter for the shared publication boundary. Everything about the
 * four-resource publish batch, idempotency, and withdrawal lives in
 * `shared/artifact-revisions/services/artifact-publication-service.ts`; this
 * file supplies only what is tunnel-specific — the private revision that
 * provides provenance, the sanitized public payload, and the poster.
 *
 * The poster is rendered fresh rather than lifted off the saved work. The
 * inline `poster` field is a 200px thumbnail sized for the collection grid,
 * where it rides inside each tunnel's own Firestore document; Explore hangs
 * artwork on a plinth that reaches ~950 CSS px at 4K, so re-using the thumbnail
 * upscaled it ~4.8x. `renderTunnelDiscoveryPoster` re-renders the tunnel
 * offscreen at 1024 and falls back to the thumbnail only if that render
 * produces nothing, so a publish never fails on its poster.
