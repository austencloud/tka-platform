/**
 * Reproduce a saved tunnel in the real sequence viewer: apply the snapshot's
 * global/persisted state, then open the viewer overlay with its sequence. The
 * viewer boots showing the exact saved tunnel. With `autoExport`, an intent
 * flag is seeded so the viewer fires its tunnel video export once ready.
 *
 * Two seam classes are in play, and the ordering below is load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **Live singletons** (visibility manager, animationSettings, settingsService)
 *    are app-wide; setting them here applies immediately and the freshly-mounted
 *    viewer reads the same instances.
 *  - **Per-mount state** (tunnel controller, effects config, viewer mode) is
 *    reconstructed every time the viewer mounts. The viewer overlay is gated by
 *    `{#if overlay.sequence}` in SequenceViewerDrawerHost, so it unmounts on
 *    close and mounts FRESH on open — a fresh `TunnelViewController`
 *    (`loadTunnelViewState`), `createEffectsConfigState({persist:true})`
 *    (`loadStoredConfig` → EFFECTS_CONFIG_STORAGE_KEY), and `createViewerState`
 *    (`loadViewerMode`) each re-read localStorage at construct time. So we
 *    pre-seed those localStorage keys BEFORE calling `openSequenceOverlay`.
 *    `openSequenceOverlay` flips reactive state; the fresh mount runs in a later
 *    microtask, after these synchronous writes have landed.
 *
 * Every one of these writes overwrites settings the user configured for
 * themselves, with no prior warning. So the very first thing this function
 * does is snapshot the pre-apply state (`captureSettingsCheckpoint`), and
 * once the tunnel is open it shows a toast with an Undo button that puts
 * everything back (`revertSettingsCheckpoint`) and closes the viewer this
 * call opened — undoing the whole gesture, not just the settings.
