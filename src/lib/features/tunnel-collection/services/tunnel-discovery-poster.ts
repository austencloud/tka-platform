/**
 * Renders a saved tunnel offscreen and composites its canvas layers down into a
 * poster.
 *
 * The picture is the tunnel's COMPLETE traced figure, not a frame of it, and it
 * is the same picture every time — see `domain/tunnel-poster-look.ts` for what
 * that changes and why. This module owns the other half: mounting the real
 * renderer, waiting for the figure to finish drawing itself, and encoding it.
 *
 * Two sizes come out of the same pipeline. The in-document `tunnel.poster` is a
 * 200px thumbnail — right for the collection grid, where every tunnel's poster
 * rides inside its own Firestore document. Explore puts artwork on a plinth
 * that reaches ~950 CSS px on a 4K canvas, so it gets its own 1024px image in
 * Storage; re-using the thumbnail there is what made published tunnels read as
 * blocks.
 *
 * Rendering rather than upscaling also means the poster is resolution- and
 * machine-independent: it does not inherit whatever size the owner's screen
 * happened to give the preview when they pressed Share.

 * paid for in frames. A/B on the same tunnel, three captures each: parked
 * offscreen it took 9.8-10.0s and covered 10-14% of the frame; at zero opacity
 * behind the page, 3.6-4.6s and 15-19%. Zero opacity keeps the renderer at full
