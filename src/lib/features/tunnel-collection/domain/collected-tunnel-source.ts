/**
 * How to read a saved tunnel back into the things that can perform it.
 *
 * A tunnel saved before the Tunnel creator existed has no `composition` — the
 * concept did not exist yet. What it has is `steps`, the one sequence it was
 * built from, plus the formation that multiplied it. Every surface that reopens
 * a tunnel therefore has to reconstruct the cast, and each one that did it
 * privately got a different answer: the viewer rebuilt a one-performer cast and
 * showed the tunnel correctly, while the creator read `composition` straight
 * off the entry, found nothing, and opened an empty picker that still called
 * itself "Edit tunnel". One owner, so a legacy tunnel means the same thing
 * wherever it is opened.

/** The sequence a saved tunnel was built from.
 *
 *  The steps were captured from a live, already-hydrated viewer sequence, so
 *  each carries motions.blue/red — the orchestrator's hydrateSequence
 *  short-circuits on hasMotionData() and uses them verbatim rather than
 *  re-deriving from compositional fields the collection does not store.
 *  gridMode is recovered off the steps so the right grid renders.
 *
 *  A CollectedTunnel has never had a field for the start position, so the
 *  start-position pictograph has to be rebuilt from the first step the same way
 *  the hydrator rebuilds it for any stored sequence. Without this a reopened
 *  tunnel's step strip begins at step 1 with the start cell simply missing. */

/**
 * The authored cast, or the cast a legacy tunnel implies.

 * A legacy tunnel implies exactly one performer, because one sequence is all it
 * stored: every arm beyond the first came from the formation — its fold, its
 * reflections, its stagger — and those are saved on the snapshot. Handing the
 * creator a second performer here would put an authored relationship in the
 * record that nobody authored, and an identity copy shown beside its own lead
 * reads as a transform that failed to save. The creator's linked mode is what
 * synthesizes a partner from a solo lead, under controls the user can see.
