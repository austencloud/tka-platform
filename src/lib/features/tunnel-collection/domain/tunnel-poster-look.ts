/**
 * The canonical POSTER look for a tunnel.
 *
 * A tunnel's poster used to be whatever the stage happened to be showing when
 * the shutter fell: a few steps of a fading trail, the props mid-swing, the grid
 * on. Next to a mandala poster — which is derived from geometry and therefore
 * shows the complete figure every time — it read as a screenshot rather than a
 * piece of work. Two causes, one shape:
 *
 *   1. FADE mode only ever shows a moving window of the path, so the still holds
 *      an arc, not the mandala the tunnel traces.
 *   2. The overlay decays per rendered frame, so how full that arc looks depends
 *      on the machine. The same tunnel published twice gave two pictures.
 *
 * So a poster is not a frame of the live view — it is the tunnel's COMPLETE
 * traced figure, and it is the same picture every time. That is what these
 * overrides produce: the trail stops fading, so the accumulator keeps every
 * stamp and the figure closes; the grid and the props step out of the way,
 * leaving the drawing itself; and the capture then waits for the figure to stop
 * growing rather than for a clock (see `tunnel-discovery-poster.ts`).
 *
 * Everything that is IDENTITY stays: colors, stroke width, glow, per-arm
 * spectrum, the config, the effect assignment. Only the display of the trail
 * over time changes, and only for the still.
