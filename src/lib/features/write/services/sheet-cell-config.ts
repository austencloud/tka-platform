 * the same on screen as it does on paper — parity comes from sharing the config,
 * not from sharing a renderer.
 *
 * The look starts from the locked playing-card profile
 * (`buildCanonicalCardVisibility`) so a sheet step reads identically to the same
 * step on a printed card — grid, TKA glyph, hand points, reversals, light/print
 * background. Two card-only composition flags are stripped: a bare sheet cell is
 * a pictograph, not a full card, so it carries no QR code and no word banner.
