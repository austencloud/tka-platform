/**
 * Sheet row planner.
 *
 * Lays an ordered list of sequences out as one CONTINUOUS flow of cells for a
 * choreo sheet: every step of every sequence is placed left-to-right, `columns`
 * per row, wrapping straight into the next row — the next sequence begins in the
 * very next cell, not on a fresh row. A 12-count then an 8-count at 8 columns
 * fills row 1 (8), row 2 cells 1-4 (seq 1 tail) + cells 5-8 (seq 2 head), etc.
 * Only the final row is padded with blank cells to square off the grid.
 *
 * Each cell carries its `sequenceId` and whether it's the first cell of its
 * sequence (`isSequenceStart`) — a sequence's run can begin mid-row, so
 * selection highlighting and break/separator marks are per-cell, not per-row.
 *
 * Preview and PDF both consume this output, so layout is identical in both.
