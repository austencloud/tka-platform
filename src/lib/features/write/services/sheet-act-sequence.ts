/**
 * Build one continuous "act" sequence from the sheet's rows.
 *
 * A choreo sheet reads as a single performance, so the whole thing can play as
 * ONE sequence: concatenate every row's steps into one stream, renumbered 1..N.
 *
 * Pure, literal concatenation — NO orientation/reversal recalculation. The rows
 * are already normalized (clean boundaries connect; break boundaries are the
 * intentional warnings the preview shows), and each source sequence's stored
 * orientations are already self-consistent. Re-propagating orientations across a
 * break would corrupt the downstream sequence's authored look, so we keep every
 * step exactly as authored. This also keeps the function free of heavy render
 * deps, so it unit-tests trivially.
