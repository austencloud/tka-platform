 * intent in both. A cold-launch share fires twice. Deriving the id from content
 * makes the second delivery a no-op instead of a duplicate upload.
 *
 * Files are sorted so two deliveries that enumerate in a different order still
 * collapse to one id. The uri is deliberately EXCLUDED - the plugin can write
 * the same share to a different cache path on the second delivery.
 *
 * Consequence worth knowing: two genuinely different files that agree on
 * name + mimeType + size hash identically. That is the accepted cost of
 * excluding the uri without reading bytes, and it is bounded by the store's
 * one-hour TTL (Task 5).
