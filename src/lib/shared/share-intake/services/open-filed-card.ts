/**
 * Trace 1's terminal state: the user looking at the sequence they shared.
 *
 * The pipeline is the one SequenceViewerDrawerHost.bootstrapFromUrl() already
 * runs (resolve -> hydrate -> openSequenceOverlay), minus the resolve: the
 * router hands us the SequenceData that resolveForImport already returned, so
 * re-resolving would be a second network read for data we hold.
 *
 * hydrateSequence is NOT optional here. It is what fills in letter-per-step,
 * start/end position, word, isCircular, loopType and gridMode. Skipping it
 * opens a viewer with empty card footers and a null loop type - the exact
 * regression that helper was written to end (sequence-hydrator.ts header).
 *
 * The overlay renders inside SequenceViewerDrawerHost, which MainApplication
 * mounts at :708-710. That is why nothing in this pipeline may run before the
 * app shell is up - see Task 12.
