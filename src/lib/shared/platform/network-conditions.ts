 * Network conditions reader.
 *
 * Reads the browser's Network Information API (navigator.connection) so the app
 * can back off speculative work — background prefetches, fresh-data syncs, full
 * resolution background rendering — when the user is on a slow or metered link.
 *
 * Why this exists: on a fast connection the app's boot-time speculative downloads
 * (gallery sync, creator profiles) finish in a blink, so nobody notices them. On
 * a congested 4G connection those same downloads drag on for seconds, and while
 * they do they steal bandwidth and main-thread time from whatever the user is
 * actually looking at — animations stutter, the page feels laggy. Detecting the
 * slow link lets us skip the speculative work and keep the foreground smooth.
 *
 * The Network Information API is Chromium-only (Chrome, Edge, Android browsers).
 * Safari and Firefox don't expose it, so `known` is false there and we treat the
 * connection as unconstrained — we can't detect "slow", so we don't change
 * behavior rather than guess wrong.
