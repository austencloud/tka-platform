/**
 * One canvas2d overlay effect, drawn from emitter tips onto a 2D context.
 *
 * The animation engine's render loop owns the FULL effect story: deriving tips
 * from a realized sequence pose, the WebGL effects, per-effect error budgets,
 * and the overlay canvases' lifecycle. Its dispatch registry is bound to
 * `RenderFrameParams`, so a surface whose motion does not come from a sequence
 * cannot reach it.
 *
 * This is the narrower capability underneath that one: given a context, an
 * effect id, the shared effects config, and where the prop tips are RIGHT NOW,
 * draw that effect's frame. It is what lets a surface with its own kinematics —
 * the Shape Matrix theory stage traces rational spin ratios that have no letter
 * and no steps — use the same effects the rest of the app draws instead of
 * growing a private set.
 *
 * Deliberately out of scope, and why:
 *   - fire, led, charcoal: WebGL. They need their own contexts and trackers.
 *   - ghost: onion-skins the rendered prop sprites, not tip positions.
 *   - frost: retired from the roster; its code is dormant, not offered.
 *   - trails: its own renderer family with a settings pipeline of its own.
 * `CANVAS2D_HOSTED_EFFECTS` is the honest list; a host must not offer an effect
 * it cannot draw.
