 * hundreds of discrete photoreal droplets (which read as rain/specks against a
 * black void), beads of liquid are laid CONTINUOUSLY along the tip path, then
 * merged into connected luminous blobs with the metaball recipe — sum bright
 * blobs additively, then `blur(...)·contrast(...)`: blur bridges neighbours,
 * contrast snaps the soft overlap to a hard gooey edge. The result reads as
 * substance with surface tension, and it's emissive so it survives the dark
 * pictograph canvas.
 *
 * Ported from the /test/water-rethink "gooey liquid" atom prototype. Public
 * Stamps blobs through the goo overlay each frame; the overlay owns the canvas
 * and lifecycle (see GooOverlayRenderer).
