/**
 * Landing-path timing marks.
 *
 * The landing page's headline metrics all read "fast" while the page still
 * looks like a placeholder: measured 2026-08-09 on production, LCP 667ms,
 * DCL 456ms, load 862ms, CLS 0.00 — and a hero that had not drawn a frame.
 * LCP was timing the headline text. Nothing in the app measured the thing a
 * visitor actually waits for, so every diagnosis had to be reconstructed from
 * the outside with traces, which is slow and easy to get wrong.
 *
 * These marks name the moments that matter on the way to a live hero. They are
 * real `performance.mark` entries, so they show up in a DevTools trace's
 * Timings track next to the network and main-thread rows without any extra
 * tooling.
 *
 * Read them from the console with `__tkaMarks()`.
