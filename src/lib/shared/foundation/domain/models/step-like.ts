/**
 * StepLike — the structural step shape shared by the app's `StepData` and the
 * canonical `@tka/tka-types` `Step`.
 *
 * Consumers that only read structural fields (motions, positions, letter)
 * should accept this instead of `StepData` so they are already typed for the
 * StepData->Step migration: `StepData` (optional fat motions) and canonical
 * `Step` (required lean motions) are BOTH assignable to it, because
 * `MotionData` and lean `Motion` are both assignable to `MotionWithView`.
 *
 * Hands stay optional here — one-hand/blank steps are real at the edit and
 * render layers (see docs/superpowers/specs/active/
 * 2026-07-01-presence-as-signal-register.md). Consumers keep their presence
 * guards.
