/**
 * The combination engine's public seam.
 *
 * Two questions, two methods, deliberately different in cost and in what they
 * prove:
 *
 *   - `candidateWords` is the Layer 0 preview — pure letter calculus over
 *     position FAMILIES. Synchronous, milliseconds, and only ever NECESSARY:
 *     a word listed here spells a closed loop in the family graph, which does
 *     not mean concrete card material can realize it (alpha3 and alpha5 are
 *     both "alpha" to this layer, and only one of them may be where the card
 *     actually is). It answers "what could these two cards possibly spell?",
 *     which is what a picker panel wants before anyone commits to a search.
 *   - `findCombinations` is the Layer 1 search — the real answer, over real
 *     steps and real seams, and the only thing that returns a performable
 *     sequence.
 *
 * Mirrors the `shared/comparison` getter convention (a lazily-created
 * singleton, no DI container).

 * words in ~70ms — six sweeps completely too, `searchComplete: true`, with the
 * node budget nowhere near spent. The binding constraint at both depths is
 * `maxResults`, never `searchBudget`.
 *
 * So this is a product choice: a preview panel that offers five-letter shapes
 * is a list someone reads, and 19,397 candidates is a list nobody does. Raise
 * `maxLength` to 6 deliberately when a caller genuinely wants the long tail —
 * it stays honest, it just stops being a preview. (An earlier version of this

 *
 * Measured at length <=5 (2026-08-04), complete set 3,916 words in ~11ms:

 * cannot succeed:**
 *
 *   - `CsvLoader.loadCSVDataSet` never throws on a failed fetch; it catches and
 *     returns `{ success: false, data: undefined }`
 *     (`foundation/services/data/csv-loader.ts:79`).
 *   - `MotionQueryHandler.ensureInitialized` reads that as
 *     `csvData.data?.diamondData || ""`, parses the empty string into empty row
 *     arrays, and sets `this.isInitialized = true` REGARDLESS
 *     (`pictograph/shared/services/motion-query-handler.ts:33,55`). Its own
 *     try/catch only guards a parse crash, which a load failure is not.
 *   - So every later `queryMotions` short-circuits on `isInitialized` and
 *     returns `[]` forever. Not slow — permanently empty.
 *
 * Dropping the memo therefore costs a cheap re-probe and buys nothing on its
 * own; it is kept because it is honest about WHERE the latch lives (upstream,
 * not here) and because it starts working the moment the handler learns to
 * invalidate. The real fix is upstream: `ensureInitialized` should leave
 * `isInitialized` false when `csvData.success` is false, so a later call
 * retries the load. Until then the graceful degradation below —
 * `ambientUnavailable: true`, no provider attached, search still runs on card
 * material — is the whole of the recovery story, and the honest thing to
 * report to a user is "bridge vocabulary unavailable this session".
