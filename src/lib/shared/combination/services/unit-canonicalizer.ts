/**
 * The equivalence relation. Two candidate units are the same discovery when
 * this file says they are, and every count the combinator reports moves with
 * that decision — so it is stated here once, in one place, rather than implied
 * by a dedup key somewhere downstream.
 *
 * Three quotients, applied in this order:
 *
 *   1. **Whole-unit symmetry.** The D4 x colour-swap group acting on both
 *      hands' locations: four quarter rotations, an optional reflection, an
 *      optional blue/red swap. A loop and its rotated/mirrored/colour-swapped
 *      selves are one idea.
 *   2. **Cyclic rotation.** A closed unit has no first step; entering it at a
 *      different step is the same loop. (Necklace-minimal string.)
 *   3. **The gap orbit.** Rotating ONE hand by 90/180/270 walks every letter
 *      along its gap family in lockstep — EKGG, NQSS, KEAA, QNSS are four faces
 *      of one loop, with identical reversal structure. One discovery, four
 *      presentations (`docs/reference/letter-gap-families.md`).
 *
 * An earlier version of the research oracle omitted quotient 3 and reported 512
 * words for A+G where the correct figure is 256. A count that looks plausible is
 * not evidence it came from the right relation; whenever a number is published,
 * this list is published with it.
 *
 * The lookup key throughout is the full eight-field motion tuple (each hand's
 * motion type, rotation direction, start location and end location). That key is
 * what reproduces the 13 letter-gap families exactly; if a reimplementation does
 * not reproduce them, the key is wrong.
