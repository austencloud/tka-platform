/**
 * Raw walks -> ranked, labelled `CombinationResult`s.
 *
 * The search hands over closed walks in shortest-first order, deduped by walk
 * SIGNATURE (which sources, at which phases). Three things still have to happen
 * before a human can read the list:
 *
 *   1. **A verdict.** The block shape says how the two cards actually met —
 *      played back to back (SEQUENTIAL), interleaved a whole unit at a time
 *      (FUSED), cut inside a unit (BRAIDED), or none of those cleanly (HYBRID).
 *   2. **Content dedup.** Two walks over DIFFERENT sources can build the same
 *      sequence — a symmetric card's identity and its rotated variant contain
 *      literally the same steps — and the search cannot see that, because it
 *      keys on source identity. {@link contentDedupKey} can, so it is taken
 *      after `buildResult` and the first walk to produce a given sequence wins.
 *      The search's shortest-first order makes "first" mean "smallest", which
 *      is the representative worth keeping.
 *   3. **Ranking, then sampling.** See {@link rankResults} — the search's
 *      shortest-first order is deliberately NOT the presentation order — and
 *      {@link samplerSlice}, which fills the page across shapes rather than
 *      taking the top N of one.
 *
 * Results whose sequence carries `metadata.incompleteWord` are DROPPED rather
 * than shown. That flag means some spliced step is not a dataframe row, so the
 * result cannot be labelled honestly, cannot be saved, and cannot mint a
 * shortcode — surfacing it would only offer the user something that breaks
 * downstream. The count is warned once per search rather than per result.

 * into something else. `usedAmbient` is where that shows up instead.
 *
 * **Alternation is CYCLIC.** A combination is a loop, so the last block is
 * adjacent to the first and the wrap seam counts like every other seam. FUSED
 * therefore needs adjacent kinds to differ AND the first and last kinds to
 * differ. Austen's DJDJ + GGGG -> DJGGDJGG is the shape it is protecting:
 * `A:2 + B:2 + A:2 + B:2`, which alternates all the way round, including from
 * that last GG back into the first DJ.
 *
 * An even card-block count falls out of that rule rather than being imposed —
 * you cannot two-colour an odd cycle. So a re-entry shape like `A + B + A`
 * lands in HYBRID: it reads as alternating only if you stop at the end of the
 * list and ignore that the loop hands the last A straight back to the first.

/**
 * THE dedup key: are these two built sequences the same loop?
 *
 * Per step: letter, both endpoints, and each hand's motion type + rotation
 * direction + turns + orientations + locations. That is the material a
 * performer would call "the same beat"; ids and step numbers (which differ by
 * construction between two walks over different sources) are deliberately out.
 *
 * A closed walk has no start, so the key is the lexicographically smallest
 * ROTATION of the per-step keys — the same trick the search uses on its own
 * walk signature, for the same reason. PHASE INVARIANCE is the whole job here:
 * the same loop entered at a different step is the same loop.
 *
 * **Why not `SequenceCanonicalizer`?** It was the obvious candidate — it is the
 * codebase's own "are these the same sequence" — and it leaks duplicates on
 * exactly this input. Three defects in
 * `shared/comparison/services/sequence-canonicalizer.ts`, all still present:
 *
 *   1. **`:29`** — rotation normalization is gated on `sequence.isCircular`. A
 *      period-2 combination is a real, correct loop with `isCircular: false`
 *      (orientation takes two passes), so it receives NO phase normalization
 *      at all and two phases of it hash differently.
 *   2. **`:117-127` + `:145-150`** — `findCircularOffset` returns a CHARACTER
 *      index into the word (`doubled.indexOf(canonicalWord)`), and
 *      `generateCanonicalHash` then uses it to rotate `beatSignatures`, a
 *      per-STEP array. Those two indices agree only while every letter is one
 *      character; any dash or Greek letter desynchronizes the rotation.
 *   3. **`:37`** — spatial normalization is explicitly not applied, while the
 *      beat signatures underneath use location DELTAS. Two results that are
 *      90° rotations of each other can therefore collide, which is the
 *      opposite failure and the reason its hash cannot be trusted in either
 *      direction here.
 *
 * All three are still unowned — Task 12 routed AROUND the canonicalizer rather
 * than repairing it: the similarity panel it shipped reads
 * `SimilarityCalculator` and `SequenceAligner`, neither of which touches this
 * hash. Until someone does own it, its output is still carried on
 * `CombinationResult.canonicalHash` for cross-module compatibility — read,
 * never deduped on.
