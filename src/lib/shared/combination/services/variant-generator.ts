/**
 * Variant generator — every re-orientation of a card the combination search is
 * allowed to try.
 *
 * Two independent axes:
 *
 *  1. **Spatial / hand role** — rotation (even 45° steps only, so grid mode is
 *     preserved), vertical mirror, and left↔right swap. These reuse the create
 *     module's transform pipeline verbatim (`rotateSequence`, `mirrorSequence`,
 *     `swapHands`).
 *  2. **The rotation-faithful twin** — see {@link buildRotationFaithfulTwin}.
 *
 * Full liberties enumerate 4 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 candidates, twin applied LAST so
 * it operates on the already-transformed material. The emitted list is SMALLER
 * than that: cyclically-identical candidates are collapsed to one source (see
 * {@link cyclicCanonicalSignature}) — a card whose four rotations are the same
 * loop phase-shifted would otherwise flood the walk search with duplicates.
 *
 * **Letter invariance.** The spatial/hand-role transforms are letter-preserving:
 * hand swap, vertical mirror and 90° rotation each map every diamond row to
 * another diamond row with the SAME letter (verified 649/649 diamond and
 * 650/650 box rows), which is why the non-twin path never calls the async
 * letter derivation. Only the twin re-derives, because reversing the traversal
 * genuinely changes the letter (G-run becomes H-run).
 *
 * **`word` is the data layer.** Every emitted variant normalizes `word` to the
 * full expanded letter string of its own steps — including the identity
 * variant, whose incoming `word` may be a stale or hand-authored label.
 * Collapsing a repeated word for humans is `word-simplifier`'s job at the
 * display layer, never this module's.
