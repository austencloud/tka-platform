/**
 * Stage 4 — Present. Buckets, and the metadata a row carries.
 *
 * **Circle length = unit length x the order of the closing transform.** Plain
 * closes in one pass; mirrored, flipped, swapped and 180-degree rotations take
 * two; 90 and 270 take four. So one 4-step unit is a 4-count, an 8-count or a
 * 16-count depending only on how it closes, and a unit appears in several
 * buckets — once per admissible closure. Grouping by circle count first and by
 * LOOP type within it sorts the answer into the counts a performer actually
 * thinks in, which is the primary organisation the design asks for.
 *
 * The displayed word is always the smallest repeating unit
 * (`simplifyRepeatedWord`, `.claude/rules/simplified-word-display.md`): AAAA
 * reads as A, and a raw repeated word never reaches a human.
