/**
 * Stages 1 and 2 — Vocabulary and Unit search.
 *
 * **Stage 1, Vocabulary.** A card contributes its LETTERS, and each letter
 * contributes every one of its variations as an edge. That is the correction the
 * redesign turns on: a word does not determine its closure, so the search cannot
 * walk a card's recorded step order — it walks realized pictographs, and the same
 * letter from the same start may land 180 degrees apart depending on which
 * variation is taken.
 *
 * **Stage 2, Unit search.** An exhaustive DFS over those edges, bounded by unit
 * length and connector budget, requiring both cards to appear, with positional
 * continuity pruning at every step. No caps and no truncation banner: the box is
 * declared, and the search inside it finishes.
 *
 * The search does NOT decide what closes. It asks the `closes` predicate, which
 * defaults to Stage 3 (`admissibleClosures`) memoized per position pair. Keeping
 * that as an injected question rather than an inlined rule is what stops the
 * closure rule from being quietly reimplemented here — the failure that produced
 * the freeform output in the first place.
