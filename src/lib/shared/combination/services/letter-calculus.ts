 * `maxLength`. This makes the returned list — and where `maxResults` cuts it
 * off — fully deterministic and independent of ingredient array order,
 * which a single flat DFS to `maxLength` could not guarantee (a length-8
 * degenerate could sort ahead of a length-1 word depending on which branch
 * the DFS happened to explore first).
 *
 * `searchBudget` bounds the TOTAL DFS nodes visited across every depth of the
 * sweep, not just the deepest one. Because each level re-walks the same
 * shallow prefixes iterative-deepening always does, the total cost across
 * all depths is a small constant multiple of the deepest level alone —
 * empirically ~1.15x, given this graph's measured ~8.6x growth per added
 * depth (geometric series 1/(1 - 1/8.6) ≈ 1.15) — so one shared budget still
 * behaves like "the depth-`maxLength` budget," not "8x more work."
 *
 * Word-level sieve only: necessary, not sufficient — Layer 1 (seam-graph
 * search) decides realizability against concrete card material (position
 * INSTANCES: alpha3 vs alpha5).
 *
 * API-fitness note: position FAMILY is invariant under every spatial/color
 * variant a hybrid card could apply. Verified against
 * `circular-position-maps.ts`'s `HALF_POSITION_MAP` (180°) and
 * `QUARTER_POSITION_MAP_CW`/`_CCW` (90°) — every entry maps a position to
 * another position in the SAME family (alpha->alpha, beta->beta, each gamma
 * half to itself, etc.); there are zero cross-family maps in that file, and
 * mirroring/color-swap don't touch family membership either. So this sieve
 * correctly prefilters at the WORD level (which letter sequences could ever
 * close a loop, drawing from which ingredients) — variant choice (rotation,
 * mirror, color swap) is Layer 1's job, not this one's.
 *
 * Prior art (never-hand-roll accounting): sequence-engine's
 * `LetterPositionInfo` (sequence-engine-types.ts) and the spell tab's
 * `LetterTransitionGraph` (features/create/spell/services/letter-transition-graph.ts)
 * walk letters over position groups, but both are limited to alpha/beta/gamma
 * and are generation-bound (no ingredient attribution, no closed-walk
 * enumeration over a chosen edge multiset). Layer 0 needs all 7 families +
 * per-ingredient provenance, hence a new module. Consolidation deliberately
 * deferred.
