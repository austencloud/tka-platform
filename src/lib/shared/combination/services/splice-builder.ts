/**
 * Walk -> SequenceData: the pass that turns a graph object into something a
 * human can actually pick up two props and perform.
 *
 * The search guarantees POSITIONAL continuity — every block starts where the
 * previous one ended, and the walk returns to its own start seam. It guarantees
 * nothing about ORIENTATION, and it cannot: a block's entry orientation depends
 * on whatever now precedes it, which in a spliced walk is not what preceded it
 * on its own card. Card A's 4th step may have handed its H-block an `out` where
 * the H card's own cycle handed it an `in`.
 *
 * So the whole chain is re-derived here, from a single seed:
 *
 *   1. Flatten the blocks in walk order, renumbering 1..n.
 *   2. Rebuild the START POSITION through `startPositionDeriver` — the same
 *      derivation the sequence-hydrator uses. That hold IS the frame: its end
 *      orientations are the walk's only orientation input.
 *   3. `recalculateAllOrientations` — propagate from the hold through every
 *      step. THIS is the step that makes a mixed-source walk performable, and
 *      the reason a splice is more than a concatenation.
 *   4. `deriveSequenceLetters` — normalization, not correction. Dataframe rows
 *      carry no orientation (see `fixtures.test.ts` rowKey), so step 3 cannot
 *      change a letter; running the lookup anyway catches material that was
 *      never a real row in the first place, and flags it.
 *   5. `deriveReversals(..., { loop: true })` — reversal dots over the NEW step
 *      order, WITH the wrap. Splice seams are exactly where a prop-direction
 *      flip appears, which is what Austen's letter-faithful GG+HH examples show.
 *   6. Strict word + honest circularity + period (below).
 *
 * **isCircular is measured, not asserted.** A walk closes POSITIONALLY by
 * construction, but `isCircular` in this codebase means the app's stricter
 * seamless-loop definition — position AND orientation return to the start, so a
 * player can repeat it with no visible jump (`isSeamlesslyLoopable`). Hard-coding
 * `true` would have lied about every result whose orientation chain takes two
 * passes.
 *
 * **`period` carries the fuller truth.** A walk whose orientations do not close
 * in one pass is not broken; it is a period-2 (or 4) loop, ordinary TKA. The
 * period is SIMULATED here — feed the last pass's end orientations back in as
 * the next pass's seed and count how many passes it takes to return — rather
 * than guessed, and orientation closure is never forced. Location closes in one
 * pass by construction, so for a combination `period` is exactly the orientation
 * period.
 *
 * **Arrow locations are not recomputed.** A step's arrow locations are a
 * function of its own two motions' locations plus its letter, and splicing
 * changes neither — only orientations, which arrow placement does not read. The
 * variant generator already normalized them when it built the material.
 *
 * Everything here is DETERMINISTIC: ids are derived from block index, step
 * index and the source step's own id, never minted. Two identical walks must
 * produce byte-identical sequences, or the search's determinism guarantee stops
 * at this boundary. (`startPositionDeriver`'s own id, `derived-start-<position>`,
 * is derived too — unlike `createStartPositionFromBeatStart`, whose id is
 * `start-derived-${Date.now()}`.)
