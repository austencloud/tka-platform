/**
 * The ambient provider that finally connects the combination engine to the
 * real pictograph dataset.
 *
 * The engine asks one question — "what ambient material STARTS at this seam?"
 * — and every test until now answered it with a hand-built stub over the
 * fixtures. This is the production answer: the app's own `motionQueryHandler`,
 * the same service the construct tab's option picker asks what may come next.
 *
 * **Why a probe step.** The handler's real entry point is
 * `getNextOptionsForSequence(sequence, gridMode)`, which takes the
 * sequence-so-far and matches each candidate's START locations against the
 * last step's END locations (see `option-loader.ts` for the app's use of the
 * same call). The engine has no sequence at this point — it has a bare seam,
 * which is precisely the pair of hand locations
 * `getGridLocationsFromPosition` already maps a `GridPosition` to. So a
 * one-step PROBE is built that simply STANDS at the seam (both hands static,
 * start location = end location), and the handler answers with everything that
 * can follow it. That reuses the app's seam matching rather than
 * re-implementing a by-start-position scan over the dataframe.
 *
 * The probe's orientations are IN/IN and are deliberately meaningless: a bare
 * seam carries no orientation history. The handler rewrites each option's start
 * orientation to continue from the probe, and the engine's splice builder
 * re-derives the whole chain's orientations from the assembled sequence's own
 * start anyway (`recalculateAllOrientations`), so nothing downstream trusts the
 * value invented here. Locations and position labels are what matter, and those
 * come from the dataframe untouched.
 *
 * **What gets filtered out, and why it is counted.** Three gates, all of which
 * the engine ALSO applies to whatever a provider hands it (a provider is a
 * collaborator, not an authority):
 *
 *   1. the step must actually start at the seam that was asked about —
 *      `getNextOptionsForSequence` has a documented "no matches, return
 *      everything" fallback, and an unguarded provider would faithfully relay
 *      the entire dataframe as if it belonged at that seam;
 *   2. its letter must belong to a roster-confirmed ambient base
 *      (`ambientLetterSet`) — connective tissue, not a third card;
 *   3. its position labels must agree with its own motion locations
 *      (`positionLabelsMatchLocations`).
 *
 * Gate 3 is the one worth watching. The engine drops mismatched material and
 * warns exactly ONCE per search, so a dataframe that ever started labelling a
 * location pair differently than `getGridPositionFromLocations` does would
 * quietly cost real bridges. `stats` therefore counts every rejection by
 * category, on the provider itself, where it is inspectable from a test or a
 * lab panel instead of scrolling past in a console. Pinned at zero across all
 * 1,152 shipped rows in `facade.test.ts`.
