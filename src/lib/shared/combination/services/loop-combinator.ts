/**
 * The LOOPs-only combinator: two cards in, a finite and complete taxonomy of
 * the LOOPs they make out.
 *
 * Four stages, each independently testable, all pure but for the dataset read:
 *
 *   1. **Vocabulary** — the two cards' letters, each contributing every one of
 *      its variations as an edge, plus the connectors (`unit-search.ts`).
 *   2. **Unit search** — exhaustive DFS inside a declared box (`unit-search.ts`).
 *   3. **Closure** — the app's own LOOP machinery decides which types each
 *      realized position pair admits; anything admitting none is dropped
 *      (`loop-closure.ts`).
 *   4. **Present** — bucket by full circle count, group by closure inside the
 *      bucket (`circle-buckets.ts`).
 *
 * Between 2 and 3 sits the equivalence relation (`unit-canonicalizer.ts`), which
 * decides what counts as one discovery. Every number this file reports moves
 * with it, so it is reported alongside them.
 *
 * The counting convention: SHAPES at the top level, with words modulo orbit and
 * cyclic rotation as the drill-down. `rawUnitCount` is a realization count and
 * is diagnostic only — never a headline total.
