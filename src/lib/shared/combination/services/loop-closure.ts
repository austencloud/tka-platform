/**
 * Stage 3 — Closure. The stage the 2026-08-04 engine never had.
 *
 * Hand it a candidate unit's realized `(startPosition, endPosition)` and it
 * answers with every way that pair becomes a LOOP. A unit admitting none is
 * freeform and is DROPPED, not demoted — that ruling is the whole reason for
 * the redesign.
 *
 * **The app answers, not this file.** Admissibility for a named LOOP type is
 * `isLOOPValidForPositionPair` from
 * `packages/sequence-engine/src/loop/validation/LOOPValidator.ts`, and the
 * number of passes a closure needs is the app's own
 * `getLOOPSpecExpansionMultiplier` over `loopSpecFromLegacy`. A local
 * reimplementation of the closing group exists in
 * `scripts/combinator-research/enumerate.mjs`; it is a research instrument and
 * is deliberately not imported here.
 *
 * **Both periods, for every unit that can tell them apart.** `HALVED_LOOPS` is
 * built from a 180-degree position map and `QUARTERED_LOOPS` from the 90-degree
 * CW/CCW maps, and the validator picks the set by period. Asking only at the
 * default halved period hides every quartered LOOP — which is A+G's entire
 * 16-count bucket, i.e. every mixed-crossing combination this feature exists to
 * find (verified live: alpha3 -> alpha5 answers `rewound` only at halved, and
 * `rotated` + `rotated_inverted` + `rotated_swapped` at quartered).
 *
 * The converse matters just as much and is easy to miss: for a type carrying no
 * ROTATED component the validator IGNORES the period argument, so a second query
 * returns the identical boolean while `getLOOPSpecExpansionMultiplier` doubles
 * the circle. Emitting that pair would invent a quartered closure the validator
 * never asserted. Measured on A+G: querying period-blind types at both periods
 * moves the 16/20/24 buckets from 12/50/54 to 32/80/144 — 110 phantom rows.
 * `quarteredPeriodBlindTypes` exists so that behaviour can be turned on
 * deliberately, and it is off.
 *
 * Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-sequence-combinator-redesign-design.md`
 * Oracle: `scripts/combinator-research/by-count.mjs`
