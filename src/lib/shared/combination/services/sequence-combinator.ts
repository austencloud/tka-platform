/**
 * Layer 1 — the seam-graph closed-walk search.
 *
 * A **seam** is the total position between two steps (`GridPosition`, e.g.
 * "beta5"). Every card is a cyclic list of steps, and every step is an edge
 * from one seam to another. A COMBINATION of two cards is a closed walk in the
 * union of those edge sets that uses at least one step from each card — nothing
 * more exotic than that, which is why concatenation ("play all of A, then all
 * of B") and interleaving ("one step of A, one of B, ...") fall out of the same
 * search rather than needing separate code paths.
 *
 * The material the walk may use:
 *   - card A as given (the FRAME — never rotated, mirrored or colour-swapped,
 *     because the result is expressed in card A's orientation);
 *   - card A's rotation-faithful twin (`buildTwinSource`);
 *   - every distinct variant of card B (`buildVariants` — rotation, mirror,
 *     colour swap, twin, deduped cyclically).
 *
 *   - AMBIENT base-vocabulary steps (ΦΨ bridges and friends), when the caller
 *     supplies an `ambientProvider`. These are not one of the two things being
 *     combined; they are connective tissue that lets two cards sharing no seam
 *     meet at all — AAAA lives in the alpha world and HHHH in the beta world,
 *     and one Ψ across plus one Φ back is the whole difference between
 *     "impossible" and Austen's AAAAΨHHΦ.
 *
 * **Two claims, kept apart.** The reachability precheck below decides
 * `impossible` — a structural, any-length proof that costs O(seams). The walk
 * search decides what EXISTS, and its failure to find something is reported as
 * `searchedToLength` ("nothing of this length or shorter"), never as
 * impossibility. A bounded search cannot prove a negative, and conflating the
 * two would let a budget timeout masquerade as a theorem.
 *
 * **Ambient edges are part of the precheck, not just the search.** The precheck
 * and the DFS must walk the SAME graph, or the engine contradicts its own
 * theorem: a card-material-only precheck would keep proclaiming AAAA + HHHH
 * impossible while the DFS was perfectly able to bridge them. So the ambient
 * pool is built BEFORE the precheck and its edges join the BFS. The consequence
 * is worth stating plainly: `impossible: true` with ambient active is the
 * STRONGEST claim the engine makes — not merely "these two cards do not meet",
 * but "they do not meet even with the whole ambient vocabulary in play".
 *
 * **Iterative deepening, not plain DFS.** The walk space is exponential in
 * length, so a depth-first sweep would spend its whole budget on one very deep
 * branch and report the shapes it happened to reach. Deepening by total step
 * count instead makes the emitted order shortest-first — both the useful answer
 * ("what is the SMALLEST way these two cards combine?") and a stable one, and
 * it matches the shortest-first contract Layer 0's `enumerateHybridWords`
 * already settled on.
