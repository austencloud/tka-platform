/**
 * Stage 3 (Closure) and Stage 4 (Present) domain model for the LOOP combinator.
 *
 * The 2026-08-04 engine emitted freeform closed walks: it found walks that
 * returned to their own start seam, classified them, and never once asked
 * whether the result was a **LOOP**. There is no reference to
 * `isLOOPValidForPositionPair` anywhere in the shipped `combination/` tree —
 * which is exactly why the output was rejected ("not a single one of these
 * sequences is a LOOP and I don't want freeform crap sequences", 2026-08-05).
 *
 * This file names the vocabulary the missing stage speaks:
 *
 *   - a **candidate unit** is a realized walk (Stage 2's output);
 *   - a **closure** is one admissible way that unit becomes a LOOP;
 *   - the **circle count** is the unit length times the closure's multiplier;
 *   - a **count bucket** groups every result that plays the same number of
 *     steps, which is what a performer actually thinks in.
 *
 * Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-sequence-combinator-redesign-design.md`.

 * `loop` is the only one the app's validator answers for. The other two exist
 * because the shipped LOOP catalogue does not cover the whole closing group and
 * pretending otherwise would silently delete real results:
 *
 * - `plain` — the unit already ends where it started. The app has no LOOP type
 *   for the identity (its `INVERTED` is the nearest thing, and that is a
 *   two-pass transform), so a 4-step unit that closes in 4 steps would have
 *   nowhere to live. Every word in A+G's 4-count bucket is one of these.
 * - `reflection` — a reflection across one of the two DIAGONAL axes. TKA canon
 *   holds all four axes equally valid (`.claude/rules/tka-domain.md`, "LOOP
 *   Reflection Guardrails") and the engine ships their location maps, but its
 *   position-pair validation sets cover only north-south (MIRRORED) and
 *   east-west (FLIPPED). Dropping the diagonals costs A+G's 8-count bucket 12
 *   of its 32 words — the mixed-crossing units, the whole point of the feature.
