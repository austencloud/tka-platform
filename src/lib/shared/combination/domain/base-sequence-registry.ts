/**
 * The base-sequence registry: the ingredient vocabulary of the combination
 * engine's ambient layer.
 *
 * Every entry's `letters` (the primitive letter cycle) and `edges` (their
 * canonical position-family transitions, in cycle order) are grounded in the
 * canonical diamond dataframe
 * (`static/data/pictographs/DiamondPictographDataframe.csv`) — verified
 * directly against it in
 * `tests/unit/combination/base-sequence-registry.test.ts`
 * (per `verify-at-canonical-source.md`). `rosterConfirmed` tracks a SEPARATE
 * question: whether Austen has blessed this base's MEMBERSHIP in his 19-base
 * roster. The `rosterConfirmed: false` placeholders (CC, II, UU, VV, WΣYΘ,
 * XΔZΩ) already have fully canon-grounded `letters`/`edges` — the only open
 * question for them is roster membership, not the underlying letter data.
 *
 * Known incomplete: the 2026-08-05 algebra handoff puts the full roster at 24
 * (19 Type 1 + 2 Type 2 + 2 Type 3 + 1 Type 4). This file holds 19. Absent are
 * both Type 3 sequences (Σ-Y-Θ-W-, Δ-Z-Ω-X-) and the Type 4. Do not read
 * `BASE_SEQUENCES` as the complete connector vocabulary yet.
 * Ambient eligibility (`ambientEligibleBases`) is gated on `rosterConfirmed`
 * only, so an unconfirmed placeholder's canon-correct edges never leak into
 * ambient use.
 *
 * `word` is Austen's roster display NAME (his two/four-letter naming
 * convention for a base, e.g. "GG", "DJ", "WΣYΘ") — NOT a rendering
 * instruction. Any user-visible rendering of a sequence word routes through
 * `simplifyRepeatedWord` (`$lib/shared/foundation/utils/word-simplifier.ts`,
 * per `simplified-word-display.md`); `word` here is roster identity, and
 * display simplification (e.g. a realized "GGGGGGGG" -> "G") is that
 * utility's job, not this registry's.
