   * bounded and a bounded search that comes back empty has proven nothing. The
   * two structural arguments the engine makes: the cards are in different grid
   * modes, or no card-B seam is REACHABLE from any card-A seam in the union
   * seam graph (`gridModeMismatch` distinguishes them). Everything else
   * reports `impossible: false` and lets `searchedToLength` carry the weaker,
   * honest claim.
   *
   * **The claim is CAP-RELATIVE, and callers must say so.** The graph the proof
   * runs on is the one the OPTIONS built: card B's variants exist only as
   * `allowMirror`/`allowRotation`/`allowColorSwap`/`exploreRotationFaithful`
   * admit them, and bridge edges exist only as far as `ambientRunCap` reaches.
   * Turning a liberty on, raising the run cap, or supplying a richer provider
   * can all turn a true `impossible` into results. The honest sentence is
   * "impossible under these liberties and a bridge of at most N steps", never a
   * bare "impossible" — `ambientRunCap` is on this report so the lab can state
   * it precisely.
   *
   * Within those bounds it is still the strongest thing the engine says: with
   * ambient active the reachability graph INCLUDES the bridge edges, so the
   * claim is "these two cards do not meet even with the ambient vocabulary in
   * play". Conversely `impossible: false` with an empty result set is NOT a
   * weaker impossibility — a one-way bridge makes card B reachable without
   * making any closed walk exist, and that case is reported honestly as an
   * empty search of a stated depth.
   *
   * Suppressed outright when the ambient pool could not be built in full (a
   * provider threw or answered with a non-list): the graph is then a subset of
