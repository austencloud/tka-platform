/**
 * Early-access capability flags — surfaces that are built but not finished,
 * hidden from regular users until they ship. Defaulted off for everyone;
 * admins bypass via role in the surface's access helper, and individual users
 * are let in through their per-user enabledFeatures override
 * (users/{uid}/settings/featureOverrides, set from the admin Users panel).
 *
 * minimumRole stays "user" ON PURPOSE: the per-user override bypasses the
 * enabled check but never the role check, so an "admin" role here would lock
 * the early-access users out — the whole point of the flag.
