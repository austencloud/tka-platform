/**
 * Auth Submission -> PostHog Bridge
 *
 * `user_signed_up` (the funnel's terminal event) fires from
 * auth-state.svelte.ts, deep inside Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener.
 * That file only ever sees "a user object appeared" - it has no idea which
 * button the visitor just pressed - and it belongs to a different workstream,
 * so threading `method`/`auth_mode` into its existing capture call isn't an
 * option here.
 *
 * PostHog's `register_for_session` solves this without threading a prop
 * through four component layers: it attaches the given properties to every
 * event this browser fires for the rest of the current session. Call it the
 * moment a credential is submitted (the same instant `trackAuthModalSubmitted`
 * fires) and the very next capture() call - `user_signed_up`, fired from the
 * auth-state-change handler this submission triggers - picks up `method` and
 * `auth_mode` automatically. Session-scoped (not the indefinite `register`) so
 * a submission that somehow never gets cleared expires with the tab instead of
 * tagging next month's events too.
 *
 * TIMING IS LOAD-BEARING. onAuthStateChanged fires within milliseconds of the
 * credential call resolving, so `recordAuthSubmission` must run IMMEDIATELY
 * after that call - before any profile update, verification email, or UX-pacing
 * delay. EmailPasswordAuth's signup branch originally called it after a 1200ms
 * success-message pause, which meant `user_signed_up` had already shipped
 * unenriched and the late registration then rode along on unrelated events for
 * the rest of the session. Both halves of that bug were the same ordering
 * mistake.
 *
 * `clearAuthSubmissionBridge` still runs the moment the modal's outcome is
 * settled (success or abandonment - see SiteHeader.svelte and
 * AuthModal.svelte), so a stale method/auth_mode never rides along later.
 *
 * Spec: docs/architecture/landing-analytics-taxonomy.md §4

/**
 * Magic link is the one method whose submission and completion happen in
 * different browsing contexts. `register_for_session` is backed by
 * sessionStorage (posthog-js's own docs), which is per-tab: the visitor
 * requests the link in tab A, then clicks it from their mail client, which
 * opens tab B with a fresh sessionStorage. Tab B completes the sign-in and
 * fires `user_signed_up` having never seen the registration.
 *
 * So magic_link additionally leaves a localStorage crumb, which survives the
 * tab change, alongside the `emailForSignIn` value the completion path already
 * reads for exactly the same reason. The completion path picks it up and
 * registers there. A different DEVICE still can't be enriched - nothing
 * client-side can bridge that - and that is a documented limit, not a bug.
