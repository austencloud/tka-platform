/**
 * Last-used sign-in method.

 * Returning users forget which button they signed up with, retry the wrong one,

 * method they last used and badging that button removes the guess. Clerk,
 * WorkOS AuthKit and Better Auth all ship this; the win is well established.
 *
 * What we deliberately do NOT store: the email, the display name, the uid.
 * Only the method name. The usual criticism of this pattern is that it leaks
 * WHO owns the device to anyone who opens the login screen — storing nothing
 * but "google" defuses that. It also means this file never touches PII.
 *
 * Device-scoped (localStorage), and it deliberately SURVIVES sign-out: the
 * whole point is the next sign-in on this device. Account deletion clears it.
