/**
 * Detects in-app browsers — Instagram, Messenger, TikTok, and friends — so the
 * app can say which parts of sign-in work here and which do not.
 *
 * This file used to justify itself with "these webviews partition
 * sessionStorage, breaking Firebase's signInWithRedirect." That justification
 * described code the app does not contain: a repo-wide search for
 * signInWithRedirect finds nothing but that sentence. Sign-in runs through
 * signInWithPopup and signInAnonymously, and the thing that actually fails in a
 * webview is the OAuth popup, which Google rejects server-side with
 * 403 disallowed_useragent. Guest identity, construct/assemble/generate, and
 * email-link sign-in all work in here.
 *
 * So detection feeds a dismissible banner and a click-time interception on the
 * two provider buttons. It must never gate page load again — a real visitor
 * from an Instagram DM was told sign-in was impossible while sitting on a page
 * he could have used as a guest.
 *
 * Design: docs/architecture/in-app-browser-path.md
