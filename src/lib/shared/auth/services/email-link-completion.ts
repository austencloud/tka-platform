/**
 * Magic-link (email-link) sign-in completion.
 *
 * Two phases, deliberately split so the single-use oobCode is never consumed
 * without a human in the loop:
 *
 *  - Detection (`isEmailLinkPending`, `getSavedEmailForSignIn`) is read-only
 *    and safe to call anywhere, including at app boot. It never talks to
 *    Firebase Auth beyond the local `isSignInWithEmailLink` URL check.
 *  - Completion (`completeEmailLinkSignIn`) consumes the oobCode via
 *    Firebase Auth. It must only run after the user explicitly confirms
 *    (EmailLinkConfirmModal's "Finish signing in" button) — never
 *    automatically on page load. Auto-completing on load let a corporate
 *    link-prescanner burn the single-use code before the human ever clicked,
 *    silently breaking sign-in.
 *
 * Handles the anonymous-upgrade path (link the email credential onto the
 * surviving anon user, preserving uid + data) and the email-already-in-use
 * collision path (sign into the existing account, offer to import anon drafts).
 * New links also carry a 30-minute opaque state so another device can resolve
 * the original email without putting it in the URL or asking for it again.
