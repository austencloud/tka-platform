// place (preserving its uid + all its Firestore data) rather than minting a new
// account. If the chosen credential already belongs to a permanent account we
// can't link onto the anon — that's the "collision" case: we sign into the
// existing account instead, and hand back the anon's drafts so the caller can
// offer to import them.
