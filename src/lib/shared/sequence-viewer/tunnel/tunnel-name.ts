/**
 * Tunnel NAMES — derived from the tunnel, not from the sequence underneath it.
 *
 * A tunnel used to be one sequence laid over itself, so naming it after that
 * sequence's word was the whole truth. The tunnel tab ended that: a tunnel is
 * now a cast, a formation, a prop choice, an effect assignment and a set of
 * rates, any of which can differ while the word stays the same. Two tunnels
 * both called "BBBA" is a collection you cannot read.
 *
 * So the default name reads the composition instead. It is a DEFAULT — a name a
 * person typed always wins, and this only fills the blank.
 *
 * Two callers had each grown half of this and disagreed: the viewer's save used
 * the simplified sequence word, and the tunnel creator used
 * "<lead> + <partner>". Both now route here.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 *   BBBA Duo
 *   BBBA × ΩORZ Mandala
 *   BBBA Pinwheel on fans
 *   BBBA Cross in fire multi-speed
 *
 * Words lead, because the word is what a person recognizes, and they stay
 * uppercase so TkaLabel draws them in the alphabet's own glyphs. Everything
 * after them is lowercase or Title Case prose, which is exactly what keeps the
 * glyph renderer off it: a token is alphabet only when every unit is a
 * canonical letter, and no canonical letter is lowercase Latin.
 *
 * Only DISTINGUISHING facts appear. A default staff, an empty effect map and a
 * single rate say nothing about this tunnel that is not equally true of every
 * other one, so they are omitted rather than padded in.
