/**
 * t3 slice — 3D viewer state <-> URL payload.
 * Capture: diff vs POST-NORMALIZE defaults (null at defaults), one sub-key per
 * encoded store. Seed: merge onto those same defaults (the sender diffed
 * against them).
 *
 * ## What the six candidate 3D stores turned out to be
 *
 * | key | owner | verdict |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `tka-viewer3d-environment` | `viewer-3d-state.svelte.ts`, per-mount factory built at orchestrator scope | ENCODE as `env` |
 * | `tka-scene-features` | `scene-feature-state.svelte.ts`, per-mount factory built inside `Viewer3DCanvas` | ENCODE as `features` |
 * | `tka-3d-quality-tier-override` | `QualityTierDetector` | EXCLUDE — device capability |
 * | `tka-3d-animator-state` | `scene3d-persister.ts` | EXCLUDE — dead key |
 * | `tka-3d-playback-state` | `createPlaybackState` default key | EXCLUDE — unreachable + transient |
 * | `tka-scene-audio-v1` | `sceneAudioState` singleton | EXCLUDE — device-personal, not visual |
 *
 * **Quality tier is deliberately never encoded.** `tka-3d-quality-tier-override`
 * describes the GPU in front of the sender, not the scene they composed. A
 * sender on a workstation must not push HIGH onto a phone (or LOW onto a
 * workstation) just by sharing a link; the recipient's own detection and
 * adaptive-DPR loop own that number. It is excluded in both directions.
 *
 * **`tka-3d-animator-state` is a dead key.** `scene3d-persister.ts` exports
 * `saveScene3DState`/`loadScene3DState`, `get-scene-3d-persister.ts` re-exports
 * them, and a repo-wide search finds no other importer of either module — so
 * nothing reads or writes that key at runtime. There is no live state to
 * snapshot and seeding it would change nothing on screen.
 *
 * **`tka-3d-playback-state` is never written either.** It is only
 * `createPlaybackState`'s DEFAULT storage key, and all three call sites pass an
 * explicit `persistenceKey`: `avatar-instance-state.svelte.ts` uses
 * `tka-3d-playback-${id}` (per performer) and the 3D workbench route uses its
 * own. Its contents are also the wrong kind of state for a link — `isPlaying`
 * is transient (the viewer's own playback controller owns whether a shared link
 * arrives playing), and per-performer `speed`/`loop` are keyed by an avatar id
 * the recipient's cast need not contain.
 *
 * **`tka-scene-audio-v1` is excluded as device-personal.** `masterVolume` and
 * `muted` describe the recipient's room and headphones, the same class of fact
 * as the GPU tier: a sender at full volume must not unmute a phone in a quiet
 * space. `playing` and `audioUnlocked` are transient runtime — browser autoplay
 * policy gates them behind a gesture the recipient has not made yet, so they
 * cannot be restored from a URL at all. That leaves `trackPreferences` (which
 * ambient track a scene variant plays) as the one durable, non-device field,
 * and this feature's contract is the viewer's VISUAL state; shipping a link
 * that carried a soundtrack choice while the volume it plays at stayed the
 * recipient's would be an incoherent half-encode. The whole store stays out.
 *
 * ## Deliberate omissions inside the two encoded stores
 *
 * From the scene-feature state: `readySet`, `progressMap`, `errorMap`,
 * `retryRequestMap` and `warmupProgress` are load-cycle runtime, not settings —
 * the store itself never persists them, and a recipient's assets load on their
 * own clock. Only the enabled map travels.
 *
 * From viewer-3d-state: the other twelve `tka-viewer3d-*` keys (camera,
 * performers, formation, planes, prop, nav mode, presets, effect toggles,
 * ocean variant, grid labels, selected index, render mode) are NOT in this
 * task's store list and stay out. `performers` in particular is the one that
 * would decide the payload's size — a full `StoredPerformerSnapshot[]` with
 * per-performer position, facing, planes and settings dwarfs everything else in
 * the blob, so adding it is a sizing decision, not a mechanical extension.
 *
 * ## Diff baselines
 *
 * Baselines are what a factory-fresh load actually HOLDS, never a raw constant
 * (the trap that stamped a bogus `fx=` onto untouched viewers).
 *
 * - `features`: a fresh `createSceneFeatureState()` with nothing stored resolves
 *   every key to its registry `defaultEnabled` — no forced or derived fields —
 *   so the registry IS the post-normalize default. `t3-slice.test.ts` proves it
 *   against a real isolated instance so a future normalize change fails loudly.
 * - `env`: the baseline is `DEFAULT_SCENE_ENVIRONMENT_ID`. A viewer whose
 *   environment is anything else emits it, INCLUDING a first-use value derived
 *   from the sender's own app background — the environment is the single most
 *   visible 3D choice, and a link that elided it would silently repaint the
 *   scene in the recipient's theme. The own-link rule still keeps that from
 *   flipping the sender's own reopened link into view-only: `isOverride`
 *   compares against `persistedT3SliceFromStorage`, which reproduces the same
 *   payload from the recipient's disk.
 *
 * No mirror-pair fields here (unlike fx's activeEffect/tipEffectMap or an's
 * effortPreset/tipEffortMap) — env and the feature toggles are independent.
