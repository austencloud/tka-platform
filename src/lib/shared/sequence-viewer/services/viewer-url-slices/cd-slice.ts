/**
 * cd slice — choreo-card composition <-> URL payload.
 * Capture: per-key diff vs POST-NORMALIZE defaults (null at defaults), plus the
 * viewed sequence length's per-length choices.
 * Seed: merge onto those same defaults (the sender diffed against them), with
 * the excluded fields kept at the RECIPIENT's live values.
 *
 * Discovery: the card's column count has no separate owner. The
 * `columnCount: null` in `viewer-orchestrator-context-state.svelte.ts` is a
 * hardcoded "no explicit prop" pass-through; `ChoreoCard.svelte` then falls back
 * to `compositionManager.getColumnCountForStepCount(stepCount)`. Every writer
 * agrees — `ExportImagePanel.setColumns`, the card context menu
 * (`card-menu-section.ts`), and `choreo-card-layout-state` all read and write
 * that one manager ("The composition manager is the one owner for columns. It
 * persists a choice per sequence length"). So this slice owns both halves of
 * Task 12: `cols` is that manager's per-length column choice, and the blob
 * carries the rest of its state.
 *
 * `getImageCompositionManager()` is a module singleton (preserved across HMR)
 * that ~10 files call directly with no injection seam, so this slice clones the
 * `an`/`ex` MEMENTO pattern rather than fx's instance seam.
 *
 * Every write path of that store, and how each is gated while borrowed:
 *   1. `writeLocalCopy()` -> `tka-image-composition-settings`. Suspended.
 *   2. `writeScopedColumnPreference()` -> `…:column-preferences-v1:<owner>`.
 *      Suspended.
 *   3. `pushAccountSettings()` -> `settingsService.updateSetting("imageExport")`
 *      -> FIRESTORE + the account-settings mirror. Suspended. This is the one
 *      that matters most: a link must never write the sender's card settings
 *      into the recipient's account.
 *   4. `saveToStorage()` — the funnel every setter uses. Suspended, and it also
 *      stops recording session-identity bookkeeping, so a recipient's tweaks
 *      during the session cannot later outrank their own account snapshot.
 *   5. `settingsService.onRemoteSettingsApplied` / `onAuthStateChanged` — async
 *      identity work that can land MID-session (auth restore is concurrent with
 *      a cold link load, so this is the common path, not an edge case). Queued
 *      by `runOrDefer` and run after the snapshot is restored, so it neither
 *      writes during the session nor clobbers the link's card with the
 *      recipient's own settings.
 *   6. The one-shot `…:notesDefaultMigrated` marker in `loadSettings()`. Not
 *      gated and not a session write: it runs once inside the constructor,
 *      which fires before any viewer borrows the store, and it records the
 *      RECIPIENT's own boot migration.
 *
 * ENCODED (flat): addWord, addStepNumbers, addDifficultyLevel,
 * includeStartPosition, customName, showLoopGlyph, showNotes, customNotesText,
 * showQRCode, showMandala, startPositionLayout — plus, for the viewed sequence
 * length only, `cols` (headline param), `startLayout` and `infoCell`.
 *
 * EXCLUDED, with reasons:
 * - `darkMode`: a MIRROR of `AnimationVisibilityManager`, which this store
 *   observes and copies. The `an` slice already owns it; encoding it here would
 *   be the fx `activeEffect`/`tipEffectMap` trap across two slices, and the
 *   seeded value would immediately be overwritten by the visibility observer.
 *   It is also why the diff baseline can be the raw constant: a factory-fresh
 *   load takes `darkMode` from that manager, not from the constant.
 * - `addUserInfo`: derived. `createSettings()` forces `addUserInfo === showNotes`
 *   on every load, so it carries no state of its own.
 * - `columnCountPreferenceOwner` / `columnCountPreferenceVersion`: identity
 *   provenance. The owner string is literally `user:<sender uid>` — a UID must
 *   never travel in a shareable URL — and a foreign owner would be sanitized to
 *   Auto on arrival anyway (`sanitizeColumnCountPreference`).
 * - `columnCountOverrides` as a map: per-length and identity-gated. Only the
 *   viewed sequence's length is meaningful in a link that carries that
 *   sequence, so it rides the single `cols` headline param instead.
 * - `startPositionLayoutOverrides` / `infoCellChoiceOverrides` as maps: same
 *   per-length argument, encoded as `startLayout` / `infoCell` for the viewed
 *   length only. `infoCell` is encoded ONLY when an explicit override exists;
 *   the derived value would duplicate showQRCode/showMandala.
