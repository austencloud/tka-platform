/**
 * Step Number Compositor
 *
 * Composites a step number ON TOP of an already-rendered, number-free
 * pictograph cell blob, producing a new blob whose number is baked into the
 * pixels. This keeps the expensive persistent pictograph cache (pictographBlobCache)
 * shared across steps, while still making the number part of the
 * cell IMAGE — so it dissolves in perfect sync during the viewer's crossfade
 * instead of floating above it as a separate DOM layer (which read as a flash on
 * thin text).
 *
 * The number art matches the printed-deck pipeline exactly (reuses
 * drawStepNumber), so live preview and exported cards render the number
 * identically.
