/**
 * SequenceViewerNavigator
 *
 * Centralized function that opens the sequence viewer in the appropriate way:
 * - Mobile: Opens the drawer overlay (no route change, module stays mounted)
 * - Desktop: Navigates to /sequence/[id] route (view transition, SSR support)
 *
 * Replaces all direct calls to:
 *   saveSequenceRouteHandoff(...) + goto(sequenceEncoder.generateSequenceRoutePath(...))
