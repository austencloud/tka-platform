  PracticeCountInOverlay.svelte

  The 3·2·1 count-in shown over the animation canvas while a practice ramp is
  about to start. Presentational only — the playback controller owns the count
  value, the ~700ms cadence, and the metronome ticks; this just renders the
  number and announces it.

  Visual language mirrors Recording3DOverlay's countdown (full-bleed scrim + big
  centered numeral + pop), with two deliberate differences:
   - A darker scrim (0.6 vs 0.4): 0.4 fails 4.5:1 white-on-content over a bright
     animation backdrop; 0.6 flattens any canvas dark enough for white text.
   - The live region is decoupled from the visible glyph (the numeral is
     aria-hidden) and is assertive, not polite — at a 700ms cadence a polite
     region queues and lags behind the visuals; assertive makes each token
     interrupt the last so "three, two, one" stays locked to the beat.

<!-- Decoupled assertive live region, ALWAYS mounted (empty when idle): a region
     inserted already-populated is commonly skipped by screen readers, so keeping
     it in the a11y tree lets the 0→3 transition announce the first "3". Announces
     "3" "2" "1" without reading the raw (aria-hidden) glyph or double-announcing. -->
