  StepMapEditor.svelte

  Maps a performance video's timing to a sequence, by tapping the pictograph.

  The button's face is the move happening right now. You watch the performer,
  you see that shape land, you hit the button. Every tap is the same action -
  "the props arrived at that" - which is why the screen needs no instructions:
  it is visual matching, not counting. Slow motion is what makes the match
  findable, so marking runs at 0.5x by default.

  Marking every arrival yields one more instant than there are moves: the
  opening pose, then the landing of each move. A move's arrival IS the next
  move's launch, so those marks map straight onto beatTimestamps (which has
  always meant "when move i+1 starts") plus a final endTimestamp.

  A take almost never holds the sequence exactly once. A LOOP closes back onto
  its own opening pose, which is the whole reason a performer runs it four or
  five times in a row on camera - so the run does not stop at the last move, it
  wraps to move one and keeps going for as long as there is footage. The marks
  stay one flat increasing list: index i is step `i % moveCount`, and its pass
  is `floor((i - 1) / moveCount) + 1`. See
  docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-step-map-editor-redesign-design.md.
