  PracticeLanePane.svelte

  The read-ahead lane shown in place of the side-by-side preview during focused
  practice. Pure wrapper: derives cells from the sequence and renders the shared
  BeatStrip with prefs-driven zoom + beat-pulse + tap-to-seek. No playback ownership
  (the viewer orchestrator owns currentStep/bpm and the seek).
