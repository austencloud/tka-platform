/**
 * The eight canonical moves, in the order the 2011 guide teaches them.
 *
 * Each entry pairs a restored animation with the knob values that reproduce the
 * same move. Aspect ratios are the extracted crops' real proportions, written by
 * scripts/extract-qft-frames.mjs — several of these drawings are markedly tall
 * or wide, and each card is shaped to fit its own.
 *
 * No pull-quotes. The moves are stated in their own terms — every `spec` is a
 * fact about the knob values that produce the move, which is what a reader
 * needs. The sources are credited by link in SOURCES below; that is attribution,
 * not commentary.

 * 2022. None of the three is in the archive. What the archive has is two Drex
