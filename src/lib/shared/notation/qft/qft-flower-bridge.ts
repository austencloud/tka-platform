/**
 * TKA flowers, read as QfT.
 *
 * The shape matrix and QfT describe the same geometry in two notations written
 * fourteen years apart, so this is a translation and not a simulation. The
 * agreement is checkable rather than asserted: TKA counts petals as 2·turns for
 * prospin and 2·turns + 2 for antispin (`flower-signature.ts`), QfT counts them
 * as N−1 for inspin and N+1 for antispin, and those are the same two formulas
 * once N = 2·turns + 1. The petal identity is the test in
 * `__tests__/qft-flower-bridge.test.ts`; it holds for all 56 axis flowers.
 *
 * What each notation is better at is the interesting part. A TKA flower is a
 * shape you can hold in one glance. Its QfT reading is eight rows saying where
 * the prop is and which way it is travelling at every step — the thing you can
 * actually call out to someone across a jam.
