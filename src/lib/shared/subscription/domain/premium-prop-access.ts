/**
 * Who may pick a paid cosmetic prop.
 *
 * The prop domain knows WHICH props cost money (PREMIUM_COSMETIC_PROP_TYPES in
 * prop-type-display-registry.ts). This module is the only place that decides
 * WHETHER the person at the keyboard may have one, so the answer cannot drift
 * between the picker, the keyboard shortcuts, Arena, avatar generation and
 * voice control.
 *
 * There are two worlds to get right:
 *
 *   1. The Scribe tier is shelved. `__FEATURE_PREMIUM__` is a compile-time
 *      false in every build, dev included, and the premium module it would send
 *      people to is stubbed out. Showing a "Go Premium" button here would send
 *      the user nowhere. So while the tier is off, the props are a preview:
 *      visible and usable on a dev machine or to an admin, invisible to
 *      everyone else. Nobody is offered a checkout that does not exist.
 *
 *   2. Once the tier ships, the ordinary subscription gate takes over and this
 *      module stops making its own judgement.
 *
 * Play-earned unlocking is a separate axis and does not touch any of this.
 * Paid cosmetics are not in UNLOCKABLE_POOL, so `isPropUnlocked()` neither
 * grants nor denies them.
