/**
 * Post handoff — the platform-correct way to get an artifact from the sequence
 * viewer into an Instagram or Facebook post.
 *
 * The defect this replaces: the viewer's share action called
 * `navigator.share({ title, text, url })` — a LINK-only share. Instagram does
 * not accept a URL share as a feed post, so the OS share sheet was a dead end
 * for the exact case sharing exists to serve. Every path here carries the FILE.
 *
 * Platform ceilings, verified and permanent:
 *   - Facebook personal profiles cannot be posted to by any API (`publish_actions`
 *     removed 2018, never restored). Assist-only, forever.
 *   - Instagram personal accounts likewise — Graph publishing requires a
 *     Business/Creator account.
 * Phase 2 adds true auto-post for a Business IG + a Facebook Page on top of the
 * same presigned URL this module already produces. See
 * docs/superpowers/specs/active/2026-08-09-social-post-handoff-design.md.
