<!--
  TkaLabel — a name that might contain Kinetic Alphabet words.

  Titles in this app come from two places. Some are TKA words the system derived
  from a sequence ("BBBA", "ΩORZ"); some are names a person typed ("Sunrise",
  "Tunnel #3"). A word is only a word if it is drawn in the alphabet — showing
  "ΩORZ" in the UI's sans-serif is showing the wrong alphabet — but running a
  typed name through the glyph renderer would turn it into letter soup. This
  component makes that call once, in one place, so every surface answers it the
  same way.

  The call is made per whitespace token, not per title, because a derived tunnel
  name sets a word against its context: "BBBA × ΩORZ — Pinwheel on fans". Only
  BBBA and ΩORZ are alphabet there. Everything else has lowercase in it, which
  is what keeps ordinary prose out: `Letter.ALPHA` is "α", never "a", so a token
  fails membership the moment it contains a lowercase Latin letter. An all-caps
  token that happens to spell an English word will be drawn as glyphs, and that
  is the intended trade — under-rendering the alphabet is the failure that
  matters here.

  Sizing rides on the caller's own font-size rather than a px prop, so a title
  set in `clamp()` or riding the 4K root ramp keeps its glyphs in proportion.
  The probe span is how that measurement happens: exactly 1em tall, zero wide,
  out of flow, and its bound clientHeight is the caller's em in pixels.
