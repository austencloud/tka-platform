  /**
   * LazyMount
   *
   * Defers a component's chunk (and its whole static import subtree) out of the
   * parent's eager graph. The component is dynamically imported the first time
   * `active` flips true, then stays mounted by default (keep-alive) so exit
   * animations and subsequent opens behave exactly as if it had always been
   * there. Set `keepAlive={false}` when inactive state must tear down the
   * component instance while retaining the already-loaded module.
   *
   * Use for action-driven hosts — drawers, editors, dialogs — that render
   * nothing until a trigger fires but were previously imported statically,
   * dragging their dependency tree into first paint.
   *
   *   <LazyMount loader={() => import("./HeavyDrawer.svelte")} active={isOpen} />
   *
   * The loaded component reads its own open state (props or context); LazyMount
   * only governs WHEN its code is fetched, never its visibility.
   *
   * Context flows normally: LazyMount sits in the parent's component tree, so a
   * child mounted here resolves getContext() up through the parent.
   *
   * `prefetch`: warm the chunk during browser idle WITHOUT mounting, so the
   * first `active` flip resolves an already-fetched-and-parsed module instantly
   * instead of paying the network + (in dev) on-demand-transform cost on click.
   * The same `import()` literal is reused, so Vite maps it to the correct hashed
   * chunk in production too (unlike modulepreload source-path hacks).
   *
   * `placeholder`: rendered until the component mounts — including during SSR/
   * prerender, so the static HTML reserves the loaded component's footprint at
   * first paint. Pass a skeleton whose GEOMETRY matches the loaded component
   * exactly (same aspect boxes, same chrome heights); the swap then causes zero
   * layout shift by construction (no-layout-shift.md).
