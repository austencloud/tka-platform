  Crossfade.svelte

  Generic, zero-layout-shift crossfade for arbitrary keyed content — icons,
  labels, status words, panels, small images. Change `key` and the old content
  fades out while the new content fades in, both pinned to the same cell so
  neither reflows the other and nothing downstream jitters during the transition.

  Three sizing modes:
  - default (grid-stack): a single-cell grid sizes to its largest child, and
    every `.layer` is forced to `grid-area: 1 / 1`. While the old layer is still
    outro-ing and the new layer is intro-ing, both occupy that one cell, so the
    box is the max of the two and siblings don't move. Use for CONTENT-SIZED
    things (labels, icons, status words) — the box hugs the content.
  - `fill`: layers become `position: absolute; inset: 0` inside a `relative`,
    parent-sized wrapper. Use when the crossfade must fill a sized parent (a
    panel, a fixed-size stage) rather than hug its content.
  - `animateHeight`: the box takes an explicit measured height and EASES between
    the outgoing and incoming natural heights on the same clock as the fade.
    Default mode's jump-to-the-taller-of-the-two is right when the two layers
    are close (a label, a status word): the box barely moves and siblings hold
    still. It is wrong when they differ a lot — a 550px roster swapping for an
    1130px inspector teleports the box on the first frame and then fades inside
    an already-arrived container, which reads as a broken transition rather than
    a transition. Turn this on when the layers differ by more than a hair.

  Both are the same no-layout-shift guarantee as the ghost-sizer idiom
  (PipelineEditorDock `.dock-title`), generalized to transitioning content.

  REMOUNT — read before reaching for this on heavy content: `{#key}` REMOUNTS
  children on every change. Cheap for icons/labels/light panels; wasteful (and
  state-losing: scroll, focus, in-progress work) for canvases, large pictograph
  renders, or stateful heavy panels. Those route through the dual-source
  CellRenderer (`src/lib/shared/sequence-viewer/components/CellRenderer.svelte` +
  `crossfader-state.svelte.ts`) so nothing remounts — solved, perf-tuned,
  dark-mode aware. The remount cost (not the sizing) is the carve-out line.
