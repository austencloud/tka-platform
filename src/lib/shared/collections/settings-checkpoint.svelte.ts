/**
 * Restoring a saved tunnel or 3D scene doesn't just open a viewer — it also
 * overwrites app-wide settings the user had dialed in themselves (effort
 * preset, path lines, trail look, prop types, the 2D background theme, every
 * `tka-viewer3d-*` knob…). Without this, restoring one saved piece of art
 * quietly rewrites what every OTHER sequence looks like afterward, with no
 * way back.
 *
 * `captureSettingsCheckpoint` snapshots everything either apply path can
 * touch, right before it touches it. `revertSettingsCheckpoint` puts it all
 * back — through the same live setters the apply paths use (so already-
 * mounted components pick up the change immediately, not just on next
 * reload) plus the raw localStorage keys a freshly-mounted viewer reads at
 * construct time.
 *
 * This file needs `.svelte.ts` (not plain `.ts`) because `animationSettings`
 * .trail comes from a `$state` singleton and its `additionalLayerColors`
 * field is a nested array — a shallow copy would keep sharing that array
 * with the live reactive object. `$state.snapshot()` is a rune; runes only
 * compile inside `.svelte`/`.svelte.ts` files, so we escalate the file type
 * here rather than risk a stale/mutated snapshot.
