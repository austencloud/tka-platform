/**
 * LED photometry — the one place the light math lives.
 *
 * Both LED backends (WebGL2 `led/web-gl-led-renderer.ts` and the WebGPU
 * `render-graph/services/web-gpu-led-executor.ts`) consume these functions so
 * the two cannot drift on physics; only the shader plumbing differs between
 * them.
 *
 * The model is a photographic one. A prop carries a fixed luminous flux budget
 * that its LEDs divide between them, each LED deposits that flux along the path
 * it sweeps during a frame, and the frames are integrated under an explicit
 * shutter. Every stage divides by something. The previous implementation
 * divided by nothing at any stage, so a 200-LED staff emitted roughly two
 * orders of magnitude more light than a 2-LED capsule and every preset
 * saturated to the same white disc.
 *
 * Four invariants hold, and `led-photometry.test.ts` asserts each:
 *
 *   1. Subdivision  — splitting a frame into more sub-steps deposits the same
 *                     total energy.
 *   2. Density      — changing LED count at fixed prop flux emits the same
 *                     total light.
 *   3. Framerate    — halving the frame rate leaves the exposure integral
 *                     unchanged.
 *   4. Degeneracy   — a stationary emitter stays finite.
 *
 * References:
 *   Zwicker et al., EWA Splatting (TVCG 2002) — reconstruction kernel must be
 *     convolved with the pixel prefilter and renormalized.
 *   Yu et al., Mip-Splatting (CVPR 2024) — the same rule for sub-pixel
 *     primitives; dilating instead of convolving shifts brightness with
 *     sampling rate.
 *   Trailing loss (LSST SMTN-002) — a streaked source's surface brightness
