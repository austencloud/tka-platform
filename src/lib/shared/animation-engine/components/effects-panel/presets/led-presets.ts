/**
 * LED effect presets.
 *
 * Each preset is a complete prop: a device, the strip pattern it runs, how
 * fast that pattern loops, and the look.
 *
 * Four looks, not six. Gradient Blade and Sunset Sweep were both a 200-LED
 * staff running a two-color gradient under an eye shutter, which is the same
 * picture Rainbow POV paints with more colors and a camera shutter behind it —
 * measured on `/create/fuse` they lit 11.0% and 9.3% of the frame against
 * Rainbow POV's 18.7%, doing a worse version of its job. Three near-identical
 * tiles do not give the user three choices; they make the one good choice
 * harder to find, and they teach that the looks are interchangeable.
 *
 * What survives is one look per idea: two discrete bulbs, two bulbs breathing,
 * a full-spectrum strip held open, and a single racing head. Everything the
 * deleted pair could express — any color pair, any persistence, any strip
 * length — is still reachable, one tap away under TUNE, which is where a
 * continuous axis belongs. A preset row is for picking a look, not for
 * enumerating a parameter space.
