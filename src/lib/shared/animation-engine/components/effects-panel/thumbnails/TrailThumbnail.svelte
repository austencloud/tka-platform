   * A trail look is three things - the colour pair, the ribbon width, and the
   * fade envelope - so the tile is two ribbons swept through a crossing path,
   * drawn at the preset's thickness and faded across the preset's own opacity
   * range. The envelope is the same one the 2D renderer gets: brightness
   * arrives as maxOpacity with minOpacity at 30% of it
   * (foldTrailIntentIntoSettings in canvas2d-translator.ts), so a dimmer preset
   * produces a visibly shorter-reading tail here for the same reason it does on
   * the stage.
   *
   * rainbow is deliberately NOT drawn. It is a primary panel chip but only
   * trail-renderer-3d.ts implements it - the fold above drops the flag and
   * neither 2D trail renderer has a rainbow path - so a tile that showed a
   * spectrum ribbon would promise something the 2D viewer does not deliver.

   * "trail" at a glance - the earlier crossing sweep was a curve nobody spins.
   * Bernoulli rather than Gerono because its lobes are round and its waist is
   * pinched, which is the ∞ glyph; Gerono's are teardrops.
   *
   *   x = cos t / (1 + sin²t)      y = sin t cos t / (1 + sin²t)
   *
   * y peaks at 1/3 (t = π/4), so the vertical term is tripled to reach the
   * requested half-height rather than filling a third of it.
   *
   * The second prop runs half a period out of phase, which for this curve is a
   * horizontal mirror: the two props sit on opposite lobes and meet at the
   * waist. Crossing is what makes a trail read as two props rather than one
   * doubled stroke.
