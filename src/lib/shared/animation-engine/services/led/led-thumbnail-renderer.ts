/**
 * Renders an LED preset tile through the real LED renderer.
 *
 * Every other effect's thumbnail runs that effect's own domain math in 2D — the
 * Coal tile runs the spark physics, the Bloom tile runs the bloom curve. LED
 * cannot: its picture is the product of a flux budget, a per-emitter Gaussian
 * splat, a motion-streak integral, a leaky shutter, a bloom pyramid and an AgX
 * tone map, all of which live in GLSL. Porting them to canvas would be a second
 * implementation of the effect, free to drift from the first — which is exactly
 * what happened before. LED's previous bespoke tile was hand-drawn from
 * constants invented to make it look plausible, shared no code with the
 * renderer, and so went on reading as convincing LEDs for weeks while the actual
 * effect on stage was a formless blob.
 *
 * So the tile runs the renderer. `WebGLLedRenderer.initializeHeadless` puts it
 * on an OffscreenCanvas, the sweep below feeds it frames, and the composited
 * result is copied out. A tile produced this way cannot be wrong about its own
 * effect: if the look changes, the tile changes with it, because it is the same
 * code.
 *
 * The only synthetic part is geometry, and it has to be — a tile has no
 * sequence. Colors come from the same `materializeGeneratorPattern` +
 * `patternFrameIndex` path `led-sampler.ts` uses on stage, so what each LED is
 * showing at a given instant is shared exactly.

 *
 * The spin is timed off the LOOK, not fixed, and that is the trick the tile
 * turns on. A staff spun about its center sweeps a solid disc, so how the tile
 * reads comes down to how many times the strip repaints that disc inside the
 * window the shutter can still see. Fixed spins were tried twice and failed the
 * same way: at 1.2s and again at 0.9s, Rainbow POV's 2.5s exposure laid its
 * disc down two and three times over, every hue fell on every other hue, and
 * the one preset whose entire point is a visible spectrum clipped to a white
 * blob. Two revolutions per visible window, with the drift separating them,
 * fixes it structurally rather than by quietly dimming the preset.
 *
 * The drift is a straight line, not an orbit. An ellipse was tried and left the
 * props wherever their phase happened to land — one high right, one low left,
 * a different composition per preset because each look has its own window. A
 * line centred on the station is the same picture every time.

 * swept disc — every revolution after that is a second coat on a finished wall,
 * and on a long exposure a second coat is what takes the color out. Rainbow POV
 * at 2.6 revolutions was a pastel slab; the hues only survive when each part of
 * the disc is written about once.
 *
 * Which of the two a strip is depends on the pattern as much as the device, so
