/**
 * Trail Overlay Canvas
 *
 * Dedicated Canvas2D overlay for trail rendering. Accumulates trail pixels
 * and fades them with the `destination-out` composite operation, producing
 * smooth trail decay that persists across sequence boundaries.
 *
 * Architecture follows the fire renderer pattern: reads prop tip positions
 * directly from PropState each frame (via PropPositionCalculator), maintaining
 * its own internal ring buffer. This makes it completely independent of the
 * SequenceCache/TrailCapturer pipeline, so sequence transitions are seamless.
 *
 * Follows the same overlay pattern as WebGLFireRenderer and LedOverlayRenderer:
 * position: absolute, pointer-events: none, z-index: 1.
 *
 * @deprecated Superseded by render-graph TrailPassExecutor + WebGL2Backend/WebGPUBackend.
 * Trail capture → TrailTranslator → TrailPass → GPU ping-pong decay.
 * Gated behind window.__TKA_UNIFIED_VIEWER.
