/**
 * buildHalvedStep(step, t) — Phase 3 core: compose a REAL pictograph of a
 * step's halfway state, per hand.
 *
 * This is not an arithmetic trick — it builds an actual synthetic StepData
 * whose end state IS the state at fraction t, so the existing prepare/render
 * pipeline (props from location+orientation, arrow from the Phase 2 `segment`
 * branch) can render it with zero new renderer code.
 *
 * Per hand:
 *   - a placeholder/invisible motion (see `isVisibleMotion`) carries through
 *     unchanged — a hand that isn't really there doesn't get "halved".
 *   - a FLOAT motion bails the WHOLE step to null. No `float_half` asset
 *     exists yet (spec §9 restricts v1 to pro/anti/dash/static).
 *   - a skewed motion (`skewSteps`/`skewDir` set) bails the whole step to
 *     null. Skew's arc-length math for orientation-at-t isn't validated for
 *     v1 (spec §9) — halving is restricted to non-skew motions.
 *   - `calculateOrientationAt` is the keystone (see ./orientation-at.ts) and
 *     is the ONLY source of the halfway orientation. It is called with the
 *     hand's own `MotionColor` explicitly (the function defaults to RED, so
 *     a blue hand passed without the 3rd arg would silently compute red's
 *     angle). A null result means the physical staff angle at t is off the
 *     45deg lattice (no legal Orientation exists there — e.g. an L4
 *     quarter-turn) and bails the whole step.
 *
 * On t !== 0.5: this function ALWAYS returns null. The signature keeps a `t`
 * parameter for future generality (the segment shape already supports
 * arbitrary {t0,t1}), but v1 only supports the midpoint. This corrects an
 * over-claim in spec §7 (docs/superpowers/specs/
 * 2026-07-14-halved-pictograph-pipeline-design.md) that on-lattice quarter
 * frames (t=0.25/0.75) "route through the pipeline" the same way halves do:
 * quarters CAN have a legal orientation (the 45deg lattice check in
 * `calculateOrientationAt` doesn't care which fraction it's asked about), but
 * they do NOT have a legal grid LOCATION. A shift's quarter-point sits 1/4 of
 * the way along the diamond-grid arc between two named points — physically
 * between the grid's 8 named locations, not on any of them. Only the
 * midpoint of a cardinal-to-intercardinal (or intercardinal-to-cardinal) arc
 * lands on a point this pipeline can name (see `SHIFT_MIDPOINTS` below).
 * Quarter frames stay on the guide's visual `poseArrow` path.
 *
 * Null contract, once more for callers: null = "not pipeline-representable
 * at this t" (off-lattice orientation, unsupported motion family, or no
 * named halfway location) — render a visual pose instead (the guide's
 * existing `poseArrow`/`halfwayPose` path), don't guess.
