/**
 * Effect layer resolution.
 *
 * Each overlay canvas sits on one of three z-index slots:
 *   1 = trail (behind everything)
 *   2 = default effect behind props
 *   3 = main canvas (grid + glyphs + props)
 *   4 = effect override in front of props
 *
 * Users toggle individual effects between "behind" and "front" via the
 * effects panel. The effects domain owns each effect's default intent; this
 * module only maps that resolved intent to renderer stacking slots.
