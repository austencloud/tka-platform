 * before that idle slot arrives — the Browse animation sheet, the sequence
 * viewer shell's export panel, the Create export drawer — must await this
 * instead of grabbing the orchestrator eagerly, otherwise the resolution races
 * the bootstrap and throws.

 * calls share one load. Importing dynamically (not statically) also keeps
 * deferred-registrations' heavy graph — mediabunny, WebCodecs, Firestore — out
 * of this module's import cost, and avoids a static cycle with
 * deferred-registrations, which imports this file.
