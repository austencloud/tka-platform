 * still tracks the setting: the picker reads it during its own render, which is
 * what registers the dependency.
 *
 * Passing no hand yields BOTH hands as separate controls rather than one
 * control writing both. Buugeng chirality is a statement about how the two
 * props relate — two of the same handedness stay apart, two of opposite
 * handedness nest into one shape — so forcing them equal removes the only
 * distinction the setting exists to make. Prop type still travels together in
 * those hosts; chirality does not.
