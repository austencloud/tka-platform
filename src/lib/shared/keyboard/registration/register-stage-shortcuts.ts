/**
 * Register Stage Shortcuts
 *
 * Static registration at app startup so every binding shows up in the `?` help
 * overlay and in Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts (where it can be rebound, with
 * conflict detection). The actions are no-ops here; StageModule re-registers the
 * same ids with real handlers when it mounts — the manager updates the action of
 * an already-registered id. Same seam register-choreo-shortcuts.ts uses.
 *
 * Looping is not here either: the Stage transport has no loop yet
 * (stage-choreography-state's toggleLoop is a documented v1 no-op), and a
 * binding listed in Settings that does nothing is worse than no binding.
 *
 * Undo and redo are NOT here: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y are owned globally
 * by register-edit-history-shortcuts.ts, which routes to whichever editor is on
 * screen through EditHistoryShortcutBridge. The Stage renders that bridge.
 *
 * Side-effectful registration/orchestration — lives in registration/, not utils/.
