/**
 * Which marketing routes paint their own opaque surface over the cosmic
 * chrome, and what that surface is.
 *
 * Every other public page floats its content on the shared star field, so the
 * footer's translucent scrim and hairline top border read as the page settling
 * onto the sky. A room page paints ink edge to edge instead: against that,
 * the same scrim darkens downward over nothing and the hairline draws a line
 * across a surface that is supposed to be continuous, so the footer stops
 * looking like the bottom of the page and starts looking like a different
 * site. Handing the footer the page's own surface removes both.
 *
 * MarketingChrome renders the footer as a sibling of the page, not a
 * descendant, so a page cannot publish this downward through CSS inheritance.
 * The chrome owns the route decision, exactly as it already does for the
 * footer variant, and both sides read the value from here.
