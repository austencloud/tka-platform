  PictographFadeCard.svelte

  Living media for the homepage's Staff Choreography tile: a card-shaped
  medium that cycles through real pictographs, crossfading between them.
  Reuses the exact PictographContainer usage the notation tile already has
  (LaunchpadTile.svelte's "pictograph" media), with `printMode` so it reads
  as card stock rather than a glyph floating on glass — the card framing
  (white panel, rounded corners, rotation, shadow) lives in the tile's own
  `.pictograph-fade-box` wrapper, matching how `.choreo-card-box` frames
  ChoreoCard.svelte elsewhere in this same file.

  Crossfade routing (crossfade-primitive.md): a pictograph is heavier content
  than a label, so the dual-source CellRenderer path was checked first. It
  doesn't fit — CellRenderer crossfades pre-rasterized `imageUrl`/`fadeOutUrl`
  blob images produced by ChoreoCard's export pipeline, not a live
  PictographContainer render. Using it here would mean pulling in that whole
  rasterization pipeline for a single tile glyph. Per the rule's own carve-out
  ("otherwise justify Crossfade with a cadence slow enough (6s+) that remount
  cost is irrelevant"), this uses the plain `Crossfade` primitive at a 7s+
  cadence, so the `{#key}` remount cost is a non-issue.

  Cycling is client-only progressive enhancement (the tile's real `<a>` +
  heading ship in SSR regardless of any of this) and freezes on the current
  frame under prefers-reduced-motion rather than merely losing its fade —
  Crossfade already makes the swap instant under reduced motion, but the
  interval driving *which* pictograph shows would otherwise keep silently
  swapping content underneath that instant cut. Stopping the interval keeps
  the card genuinely static.
