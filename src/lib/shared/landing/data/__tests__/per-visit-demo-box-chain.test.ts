/**
 * Regression: the hero attract act chained a box-transformed sequence's start
 * position into the next draw, which always runs `gridMode: DIAMOND`. No
 * 4-step path exists from a box pose in diamond space, so the builder burned
 * all 40 attempts and threw — 239 times across 5 visitors on 2026-08-09, each
 * one dropping the hero back to the baked fallback sequence.
 *
 * Two guards now: hero-act never offers a box start as a chain target, and
 * per-visit-demo retries unchained rather than serving the fixture.
