/**
 * Shape-Matrix Hero Pool (firebase-free)
 *
 * Supplies the home hero with sequences drawn from the full shape-matrix
 * possibility space. Nothing is baked per-sequence: the 22 base words load once
 * from a static JSON (`/data/hero/tnd-base-words.json`), the cell space is
 * ENUMERATED in code (buildFlowerAxis + applyFilter — pure), and each draw
 * CONSTRUCTS one realization at runtime via `applyVariationDescriptor` (turn
 * pattern + orientation + grid). This keeps the landing bundle Firebase-free —
 * the construction pipeline was split out of its firebase-tainted host modules
 * (see turn-pattern-apply.ts / reversal-transform-apply.ts / tnd-base-index.ts).
 *
 * Space: diamond×diamond ∪ box×box cells (never mixed — "diamond on box" is not
 * ready), across the turn ratios up to MAX_TURNS × 6 VTG modes. Every uniform
 * per-hand turn on a 4-beat rotated loop preserves closure by parity, so every
 * realization loop-closes; the closure gate stays as a safety net for any future
 * non-uniform descriptor. Each draw is then tiled REPEAT× (see below).
 *
 * The element indicator's TnD element is RE-DERIVED from the final played
 * geometry (post box + post rotation), never carried from the cell's nominal
 * mode — the element is not rotation-invariant for opposite-direction cells
 * (diamond quarter-opp rotates to box tog-opp), so carrying it would mislabel.
