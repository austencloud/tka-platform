/**
 * Vivid Hero Trail Preset
 *
 * TrailSettings for the homepage attract act's canvas, passed to
 * InlineAnimationPlayer via `trailSettingsOverride`. It must never mutate the
 * global `animationSettings.trail` singleton — that singleton is also read by
 * the in-app Compose panel, and a visitor's homepage settings must not leak
 * into it (and vice versa).
 *
 * DEFAULT_TRAIL_SETTINGS is tuned for the in-app animation panel, viewed up
 * close at panel size. The hero canvas is smaller (roughly 500px) and has to
 * read at a glance from across the page, so this preset pushes the numbers
 * that control how visible the trail is:
 *
 * - fadeDurationMs 2500 → 3200: the trail hangs around longer, so a visitor
 *   who glances mid-loop still catches the shape.
 * - glowBlur 2.5 → 8: a brighter halo — enough to read at hero scale,
 *   where the in-app default reads as barely-there.
 * - tailLength 20 → 36: more of the mandala arc stays visible at once.
 * - lineWidth 4 → 5: one step above the app default so it holds at hero scale.
 * - minOpacity 0.25 → 0.35: the tail's fading tip stays legible longer.
 *
 * These are a starting point, not final. Acceptance is "clearly visible
 * trail at hero size" (screenshot-verified against the live act), not these
 * specific constants — expect a follow-up tuning pass once it's on screen.

 * do when the user picks the trail effect.
