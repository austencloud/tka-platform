/**
 * Per-visit demo — the roll itself.
 *
 * This module is the pure half of per-visit-demo.ts: it draws a difficulty,
 * runs the quality-gated roll loop, and returns the winning sequence (or null
 * when every attempt failed). It knows nothing about Workers, the baked
 * fallback, or the DOM, which is what lets ONE implementation serve both the
 * worker thread and the main-thread fallback — see per-visit-demo.ts for the
 * routing and per-visit-demo.worker.ts for the off-thread host.
 *
 * Everything it reaches is pure computation: the orchestrator, the sequence
 * engine, and the CSV loader use only fetch and IndexedDB, both of which exist
 * inside a Worker. Nothing here touches the DOM, Svelte runes, or Firebase.
 *
 * Letter pool: the FULL alphabet is in play (Greek letters and dash
 * variants included — restricting to plain Latin glyphs collapses the
 * space into alternation wallpaper like MPMN). The beginner-facing gate is
 * only that a roll must not be overwhelmingly Greek: at least half the
 * steps must render as a familiar Latin capital, so a first-time visitor
 * always has footholds, while the Greek letters keep the words interesting.
 * Rolls also need enough distinct letters to read as a real phrase rather
 * than wallpaper. A few retries, then the best-scoring roll ships anyway.

 * A roll is up to MAX_ROLLS beam searches plus a deep clone each. Measured at
 * 1.3–4.7 ms per build in Chrome, so an unyielded worst case is one 21–37 ms
 * task — over the 16.7 ms frame budget. The loop therefore yields between
 * rolls, which caps each task at a single build regardless of how many
 * attempts the quality gate costs. In the worker the yield is free; on the
 * main-thread fallback it is what keeps the frame.
