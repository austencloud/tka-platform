/**
 * Per-visit demo worker — runs the attract-demo roll off the main thread.
 *
 * The hero act regenerates a sequence for every prop change, forever. Measured
 * in Chrome on /composer: the FIRST roll of a page session costs 572 ms wall
 * clock containing a 135 ms blocking task (CSV fetch, 576 pictograph
 * constructions, engine module evaluation, first beam search), and a forced
 * ten-roll worst case is 21–37 ms in one task. None of that belongs on the
 * thread that has to paint the hero.
 *
 * The whole roll moves here rather than a single build: the loop, the quality
 * gate, and the per-roll deep clone are all main-thread cost, and keeping them
 * together means one message round trip per draw instead of ten.
 *
 * Protocol is one request, one response, correlated by id — see
 * per-visit-demo-worker-client.ts, which owns the main-thread half.
