/**
 * Hero Attract Act
 *
 * Owns the homepage hero's self-playing show: instead of one sequence
 * looping forever, the hero walks through a small cycle of props, playing a
 * freshly generated LOOP for each one before handing off to the next.
 *
 * The handoff is chained and pre-fetched so it never stalls or teleports:
 * while the current sequence plays, the next one generates in the
 * background, constrained to start where the current sequence's CIRCULAR
 * loop ends (which is also where it started — see
 * sequence-loopability-checker.ts). InlineAnimationPlayer accepts the
 * prefetched sequence inside that exact playback frame, so its clock never
 * pauses or revisits the incoming sequence's stationary start hold.
 *
 * SSR-safe by construction: state starts without a sequence, leaving the
 * host's fixed stage in its pending state. `start()` chooses the opening prop
 * and generates its first sequence after hydration, then pre-fetches the rest
 * of the act.
