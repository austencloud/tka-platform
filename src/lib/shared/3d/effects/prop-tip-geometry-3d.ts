/**
 * Where a prop's tracked effect emitters sit along its own axis, in 3D.
 *
 * The 3D tip bridge used to place two emitters at +/- staffHalfLength for every
 * prop, which is only true of the staff family. A club has ONE tip: the cap.
 * Tracking a phantom second end put a whole flame (or LED, or charcoal plume)
 * about 43cm behind the hand, out the back of the knob, where the club does not
 * exist. Every single-ended prop had the same phantom.
 *
 * How many ends a prop presents is already owned by `propTipEnds()` — the same
 * authority the 2D trail overlays, the trail capturer and the mandala use — so
 * this module answers only the 3D-specific half: WHERE along the prop's axis
 * each tracked tip lands, in metres.
 *
 * Effect-slot ordering follows the canonical 2D convention: tip 0 is the
 * pinky/LEFT_END slot, tip 1 is the thumb/RIGHT_END slot. A single-ended prop
 * keeps slot 1 — the same slot `trail-capturer.ts` gives it — so a saved
 * per-tip effect assignment means the same thing in 2D and 3D.
