  /**
   * Banked coal wall - the room's wall treatment, not a panel.
   *
   * Built as a run of cribbing bays rather than one wide rectangle. A single
   * lit plane the width of a corridor reads as a backlit billboard no matter
   * what texture is on it; a run of bays with iron posts between them reads as
   * a structure someone built to hold fuel, and the posts give the eye a rhythm
   * to measure distance against as it walks the wall.
   *
   * Three layers, front to back, and the order is the whole trick:
   *   1. the crust shader, which is the heat
   *   2. a bank of COLD lumps standing in front of it, chopping that heat into
   *      slivers - coal is never the thing that glows, it is the thing that
   *      occludes the glow
   *   3. iron cribbing in front of the lumps, holding the bank back
   *
   * Also the room's only source of vertical light. Every other station throws
   * its light from waist height or lower, which is why anything hanging near
   * the ceiling has nothing to draw it. A lit wall behind a fixture gives that
   * fixture a silhouette.

    <!-- Two lights, because one cannot do both jobs.

         The bank light sits INSIDE the coal at mid depth, and it is FAINT on
         purpose. Coal is 5% albedo; at 0.13m from a lump, an intensity that
         sounds modest delivers an irradiance in the tens and renders near-black
         rock as pale pink polystyrene. That is what the first two passes shipped
         - a rack of styrofoam. The glow between the lumps is the emissive crust
         behind them, which no light term touches; this light only has to put a
         faint rim on the front row so the bank does not read as a flat cutout.

         It is still scaled by relief squared: halve the relief and every lump
         sits at half the distance, which quadruples what it catches.

         The room light stands out in front of the grate at a fixed distance,
         so how much light the wall throws down the corridor does not change
         when the profile gets shallower. Far enough out that it grazes the
         coal instead of flooding it. -->
