   * Quench vent - look-dev study.

   * A slot in the floor where water meets hot slag, grated over in iron, with
   * a low curl of steam coming off it. Two jobs in the coal room:
   *
   * 1. It is the "heat in general" beat that is not another orange rectangle.
   *    A room lit entirely by coals is one hue from wall to wall, and a single
   *    hue has no range - the eye stops reading depth. Steam is the pale value
   *    that gives the orange something to be orange against.
   * 2. It makes the heat feel like a quantity the room is LOSING, which is what
   *    separates a worked forge from a geological hot cave.
   *
   * Reuses EmberFountains as the emitter rather than writing a second particle
   * system: it already rises, spawns on an interval and dies on a height, which
   * is exactly a steam column with the colours and gravity changed.
