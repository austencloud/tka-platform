/**
 * Which authored Autumn objects take part in the shadow pass.
 *
 * Enabling shadows on a 380K-triangle environment is only affordable if the
 * caster set is deliberate. A caster costs a second depth rasterisation every
 * frame, so the list is limited to things whose silhouette actually lands
 * inside the clearing-sized shadow camera and reads at performance distance:
 * the logs, boulders, ferns and the owl.
 *
 * The near belt and the new middle/far depth groves are excluded on purpose.
 * They begin outside the clearing-sized shadow camera and continue beyond the
 * fog horizon, so casting from them would pay large depth passes for geometry
 * that can never darken a visible performance-space pixel.
 *
 * Grass is excluded from BOTH roles here because AutumnWind owns those meshes
 * and already sets them to receive-only; claiming them twice would make the
 * winner depend on effect ordering.
 *
 * One consequence of the asset pipeline is worth knowing: the optimizer's
 * GPU-instancing pass collapses every repeated asset (ferns, saplings, the
 * small procedural fungi, birches, snags, the Poly Haven rocks) into unnamed
 * InstancedMesh batches. Those hit the receive-only default rather than the
 * caster list. That is the right outcome anyway - they are small understory and
 * far-belt geometry. Hero B's three hero placements and four saplings collapse
 * into one unnamed InstancedMesh. Casting from that mixed batch produced the
 * disconnected shadow islands found in the walk audit, so it stays receive-only.
 * The individually named Hero A meshes stay receive-only for the same reason:
 * their full crowns project clearing-sized silhouettes that read as unrelated
 * grey ground patches instead of useful contact darkening.
