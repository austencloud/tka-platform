/**
 * What each 3D environment downloads before its loading curtain can lift, so
 * those assets can be warmed into the HTTP cache before the user clicks into 3D.
 *
 * Only URLs the scene's own components load at runtime belong here, and only
 * the ones the curtain actually waits on. Four neighbours deliberately do not:
 *
 * - `*-composer-plugin.ts` catalogs, which exist for the Scene Lab and Themes
 *   Lab authoring surfaces and are never mounted by the viewer.
 * - `scenes/winter/graybox/`, a review model reachable only from a test route.
 * - The ocean fish pack (`/models/ocean/pack/*.glb`, named as bare filenames in
 *   `fish-species.ts` and fetched by FishBoids). It reports into no scene
 *   feature, so it streams in after the reveal — warming it would compete for
 *   bandwidth with the models the curtain is waiting on.
 * - `?flora=composed`, a dev-only comparison build of the reef.
 *
 * The ocean's flora scene is the one asset not written literally below. It is
 * the bulk of that scene's boot download and it blocks the curtain, but its URL
 * is environment-dependent, so `sceneAssetUrls` appends it from the owner that
 * the renderer reads too.
 *
 * `tests/unit/scene-boot/scene-asset-manifest-contract.test.ts` reads the scene
 * sources and fails when this list drifts from them in either direction.
