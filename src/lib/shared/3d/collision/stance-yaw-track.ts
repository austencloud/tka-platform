/**
 * Score-time timing for the performer's torso turn.
 *
 * `upper-body-stance-planner.ts` answers "what yaw does this grip geometry
 * want", once, from this frame alone. That answer has three properties a human
 * turn does not have: it cannot begin until the props are already 10 cm
 * lateral, its speed is set entirely by how fast the props sweep the assist
 * band, and it carries no memory across a step boundary, so a turn that runs
 * through one has nothing to flow out of or into.
 *
 * This module owns the other half: given the whole sequence, how does that yaw
 * evolve over score time. It builds a keyframed curve from the geometry's own
 * samples, moves the *onset* of each transition earlier so the body leads the
 * props, and hands out per-segment samples of one curve read at staggered
 * times so the torso arrives in pieces rather than all at once.
 *
 * Two techniques, both standard, both chosen rather than invented:
 *
 * 1. **Monotone piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation** (Fritsch & Carlson,
 *    "Monotone Piecewise Cubic Interpolation", SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 17(2),
 *    1980 — the same PCHIP that d3's `curveMonotoneX` implements). It is C1,
 *    so angular velocity is continuous everywhere including across step
 *    boundaries, and its tangent at an interior key is a weighted harmonic
 *    mean of the neighbouring secants: a turn that carries on in the same
 *    direction keeps its speed through a key instead of stopping and
 *    restarting. It also cannot overshoot, which matters here because
 *    MAX_STANCE_YAW_RAD sits three degrees short of the 90-degree shoulder
 *    degeneracy — an overshooting Catmull-Rom would ring straight into it.
 *
 * 2. **Overlapping action / successive breaking of joints** (Thomas &
 *    Johnston's principle as game animation states it: parts of the body move
 *    at different rates, overlap follows the primary mass "a few frames
 *    behind", and having every element arrive at the same instant is the
 *    classic tell of a machine-made turn). Implemented as one curve read by
 *    several heads at offset times, so every timing decision lives here and
 *    the animator applies what it is given rather than inventing phase.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT do is filter the delivered yaw. A
 * downstream low-pass was removed from `AvatarAnimator` on purpose: smoothing
 * a signal whose future is unknown buys smoothness with phase lag, and
 * mid-transition lag left the shoulders facing the previous side with an arm
 * through the head. Timing belongs where the future is known, which is here.

 * shoulder line is the one segment the grip solve hangs the arms from.
