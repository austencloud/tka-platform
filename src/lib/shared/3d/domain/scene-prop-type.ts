 * The 3D package carries its own PropType, and it only lists props it has a

 * through happened to typecheck. The energy pair broke that: they are 2D
 * cosmetics with no 3D asset of their own.
 *
 * They each follow a physical parent — Energy Saber spins exactly like a sword,
 * Energy Staff exactly like a staff — so the rig borrows that parent's model
 * rather than rendering nothing. Every other prop passes through unchanged.
