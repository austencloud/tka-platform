/**
 * The prop and build an effect needs in order to be the thing it depicts.
 *
 * Setting a day fan on fire used to burn a paper-and-fabric prop from a point
 * that has no wick, because the effect and the build never spoke to each other.
 * Rather than grey the effect out — a dead end that teaches nothing — choosing
 * an effect equips the build that can carry it: fire on a fan puts the real
 * five-wick fire fan in the performer's hand, uncovered, and the emitters land
 * on those wicks because `prop-build-tip-geometry-3d.ts` reads the same build.
 *
 * Prop swaps stay strictly inside one `SCENE_PROP_FAMILIES` family — a club
 * becomes a torch, a staff becomes a fire staff — so the change reads as a
 * build switch and not as the app taking the prop away.
 *
 * Props with no fire build in the catalog (chicken, buugeng, hoop, sword,
 * guitar) return `null` and burn as they are. Real fire hoops and fire buugeng
 * exist; gating them out would encode our missing model as the prop's limit.
