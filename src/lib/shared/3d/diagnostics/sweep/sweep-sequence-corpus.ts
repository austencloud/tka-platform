/**
 * Real published sequences as a sweep axis.
 *
 * A grip failure lives in choreography, so the sequence axis has to be real
 * choreography. The committed `publicSequences` snapshot is 568 sequences
 * people actually published; inventing fixtures instead would sweep a space
 * nobody performs. This module rebuilds full `SequenceData` from that snapshot
 * the same way the app's own loader does — the stored form is compositional
 * (two solo prop tracks plus per-step pairings), and `deriveSteps` is the
 * owner that composes them.
 *
 * Reading the file is left to the caller: a test reads it from disk, a browser
 * fetches `/data/snapshots/public-sequences.json`. This module only turns
 * documents into axis members.
