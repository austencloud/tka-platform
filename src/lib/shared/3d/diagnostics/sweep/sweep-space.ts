/**
 * The configuration space a grip/stance sweep walks.
 *
 * A performer's grip and stance solve does not fail as one bug. It fails for a
 * particular body holding a particular prop through a particular sequence, and
 * loading one of each is how a failure stays hidden. This module names the
 * three axes, builds their default membership from the catalogs that already
 * own it, and enumerates the cross product in a stable order so a run can be
 * resumed against the same list it started.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: no rig, no DOM, no WebGL.
