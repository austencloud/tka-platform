   * GaitProbe
   *
   * Drop this inside any Threlte scene that has rigged avatars in it and it
   * records what their legs are actually doing. It renders nothing.
   *
   * It samples in the RENDER stage, not the main stage. The main stage is
   * where LocomotionAnimator writes clip rotations, FootPlanter overwrites
   * some of them with IK, and AvatarAnimator solves the arms — sampling
   * anywhere inside that ordering measures a pose halfway through being
   * built. By the render stage the frame is settled, which is the pose the
   * eye is complaining about.
   *
   * The scene is re-scanned on a slow interval rather than every frame: bone
   * lookups walk the whole subtree, and a cast does not gain legs mid-stride.
