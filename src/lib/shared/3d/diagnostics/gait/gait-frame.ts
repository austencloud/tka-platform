 * IK, then the arm pass. That is deliberate. The animator's own opinion about
 * which foot is down is the thing under test, so the probe never asks it; it
 * measures the pose on screen and works out contact geometrically.
 *
 * Plain objects, no three import, so the analysis on top of it stays a pure
