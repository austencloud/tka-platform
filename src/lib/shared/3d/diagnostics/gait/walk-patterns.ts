/**
 * Walk patterns
 *
 * Ways of moving a character around, written as pure functions of time so the
 * lab that drives them holds no schedule of its own and the schedule can be
 * tested without a renderer.
 *
 * Each one exists to break a different seam. A character walking one direction
 * at one speed forever is the case every part of the pipeline was tuned for;
 * the interesting frames are the ones where a clip hands over to another clip,
 * where the blend between two of them is halfway, where the body starts and
 * stops, and where the planter has to let a foot go early because the ground
 * under it turned. Those are the frames a pattern here is aiming at.
 *
 * Every pattern returns to where it started, so the character stays in the
 * arena and the measurement never has to be interrupted to reposition it.
 *
 * A pattern never sets a position. It sets a facing and a travel direction in
 * the character's own frame, and the lab integrates the path from those at the
 * commanded speed. That way the distance covered on screen is the distance the
 * animator was told about, which is the whole basis of the stride it plays.
