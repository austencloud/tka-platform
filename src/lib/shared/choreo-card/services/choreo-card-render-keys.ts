/**
 * Single source of truth for ChoreoCard's render-trigger keys.
 *
 * ChoreoCard's onMount (to seed change-detection) and its render $effect (to
 * detect changes) both need these keys. They used to build them with duplicated
 * inline template strings; the copies drifted — `showGrid` was added to the
 * $effect's image-key `gv` segment but not to onMount's. So on the first
 * post-mount $effect run the keys never matched: classifyChange saw an "image
 * changed" with a stable grid and fired a spurious "grid-stable-image"
 * crossfade, blipping the whole grid out and back in once after the initial
 * paint. One builder used by both call sites makes that drift impossible.
 *
 * - imageKey: every prop that changes the rendered pictograph IMAGE.
 * - gridStableKey: only props that change grid STRUCTURE (count, columns,
 *   durations, start row). A crossfade-swap is only safe when this is unchanged.
 * - contentKey: imageKey + layout (columns, start toggle).
 * - renderKey: contentKey + darkMode (dark mode isn't folded into content/image).
