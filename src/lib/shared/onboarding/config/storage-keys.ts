/**
 * Onboarding Storage Keys
 *
 * Centralized storage key constants for onboarding persistence.
 *
 * NOTE: localStorage is used for synchronous access (to avoid UI flash).
 * The OnboardingPersister syncs localStorage with Firebase for authenticated
 * users for app-wide completion/skip status, profile setup progress and
 * reminder policy, and the What's New "last seen version" high-water mark (see
 * syncOnboardingFromCloud/syncOnboardingToCloud below).
 *
 * There is no per-module or per-tab onboarding tracking here. The per-module
 * surface (markModuleOnboardingComplete/hasCompletedModuleOnboarding + a
 * Firestore `modules` sub-object) was removed 2026-07-19 as dead code: it
 * served the old `ModuleOnboarding.svelte` carousel, which was deprecated in
 * favor of a planned `TabIntro.svelte` per-tab dismissal. That replacement
 * was never adopted by any tab (zero mount points from the day it shipped)
 * and was itself deleted 2026-07-19 (see onboarding/README.md).
