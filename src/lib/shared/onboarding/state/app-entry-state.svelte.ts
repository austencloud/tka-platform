/**
 * App Entry State
 *
 * Manages the post-onboarding experience:
 * - Wizard exit transition after first-run wizard
 * - Create tutorial walkthrough
 *
 * State machine phases:
 *   "wizard-active" -> "wizard-exiting" -> "create-tutorial" -> "complete"
 *
 * Returning users start at "complete" (checked via localStorage).
 * Persisted to localStorage + Firebase (same pattern as first-run-state).
 *
 * hasCompleted and phase are seeded from ONE expression (isOnboarded below)
 * so they can never disagree - see the hasCompleted-phase-divergence fix.
 * syncFromCloud() resets to the clean default on a missing doc (mirrors
 * first-run-state.svelte.ts) so a reused device doesn't inherit a prior
 * account's completed flag, and the guided-build offer waits for that first
 * cloud read (cloudSynced) before showing, for a signed-in user.
