<!--
  CollectionGalleryDetail — the shared gallery/detail shell for the Playground
  collections (Tunnels, Mandala, Scene-3D). All three had an identical
  hand-rolled `phase: "gallery" | "detail"` swap over `<Crossfade key={phase}
  fill>` with a floating "back" button. That worked on desktop but on mobile the
  detail was a full-screen phase swap with only a back button — it couldn't be
  swiped away like every other sheet in the app, and the back button (floating
  over the live tunnel canvas) mis-fired taps into the canvas.

  This shell centralises the decision:
  - **Desktop (side-by-side layout):** the detail renders in-flow, crossfading
    with the gallery exactly as before. The consumer's own floating back button
    (rendered when `inDrawer` is false) dismisses it.
  - **Mobile:** the gallery stays mounted and the detail rides the shared
    `Drawer` primitive as a bottom sheet — swipe-down / backdrop / drag-handle
    dismiss, `preventScroll`, focus trap. `onClose` flips the consumer's phase
    back to the gallery. The consumer hides its own back button in this mode
    (`inDrawer` is true) since the drawer owns dismissal.

  Consumers pass two snippets. `gallery` takes no args. `detail` takes
  `{ inDrawer }` so it can drop its floating back button when the drawer already
  provides dismissal. The source of truth for `open` stays in the consumer
  (its `phase`); `onClose` is the consumer's `back()`.
