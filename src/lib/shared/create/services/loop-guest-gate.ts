/**
 * Guest gating for the LOOP selector.
 *
 * Guests (unauthenticated) get a deliberately limited slice of the LOOP system,
 * with signing up as the unlock channel. Two independent locks apply:
 *
 *  - CATEGORY: only rotated LOOP types (ROTATED_LOOP_TYPES) are free. Mirrored,
 *    flipped, swapped, inverted, and rewound LOOPs are a sign-up perk.
 *  - LENGTH: a config whose minimum buildable length exceeds the guest step cap
 *    can never generate for a guest (e.g. a quartered inversion combo needs 16
 *    steps; guests cap at 8). Lock it instead of surfacing a raw engine error.
 *
 * Pure + framework-free so it's testable and shared across every host.
