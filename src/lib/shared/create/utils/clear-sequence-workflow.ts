/**
 * Clear Sequence Workflow Utility
 *
 * Orchestrates the complex workflow for clearing a sequence with smooth animations.
 * Extracted from CreateModule to reduce complexity and improve testability.
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. Push undo snapshot
 * 2. Wait for fade/layout animations (300ms)
 * 3. Clear ONLY the active tab's sequence data and UI state
 * 4. Close related panels
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This workflow is TAB-AWARE and only clears the currently active tab's state.
 * Each tab (Construct, Generate, Assembler) maintains independent state.
 *
 * Domain: Create module - Sequence management
