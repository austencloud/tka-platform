/**
 * Why a LOOP restricts which turn periods the strip will offer.
 *
 * A LOOP repeats a seed block: a 16-step halved LOOP is an 8-step block played
 * twice, a quartered one is a 4-step block played four times. If the turn
 * pattern's period does not divide that block, the turns drift against the
 * shape — the second repetition of the same steps comes back turning
 * differently, and the sequence stops being a LOOP in any way a person would
 * recognise.
 *
 * The whole mechanism is arithmetic plus one existing function: hand the strip
 * editor the seed block instead of the full length, and the periods it offers
 * (divisors of whatever it is given) are already exactly the safe ones.
