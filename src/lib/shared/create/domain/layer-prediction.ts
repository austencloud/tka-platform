/**
 * What layers a sequence will walk through, worked out before it exists.
 *
 * A sequence's layer signature — which of the four radial/non-radial
 * combinations the two props sit in, step by step — is its starting layer plus,
 * step by step, which props crossed. The starting layer comes from the two
 * start orientations and the crossings come from the turns, and neither depends
 * on which letters get chosen. So both halves are known while the user is still
 * setting up the generator, and the signature can be shown before they press
 * the button.
 *
 * The one thing that cannot be known ahead of time is a float. A float takes a
 * prop across only when its hand travels around the circle, and which way the
 * hand travels is a property of the letter. Those are reported as uncertain
 * rather than guessed at.
