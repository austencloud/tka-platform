/**
 * Sheet region map — where each piece of a gallery card's baked thumbnail
 * lives, as fractions of the image.
 *
 * The play-preview morph needs to pair regions of the static raster (the word
 * header, the pictograph grid, the start cell, the first few step cells) with
 * their live counterparts in the animated preview. The raster is one cached
 * <img>, so the pairing works by sprite-cropping it — and that only works if
 * the crop rects are exactly where the composer painted. This module reuses
 * the composer's own layout math (computeCardFrontLayout, extracted verbatim
 * from ImageComposer) rather than re-deriving it, so the rects are right by
 * construction for any step count and start-position layout.
 *
 * Everything here is pure geometry: no DOM, no canvas, unit-testable.
