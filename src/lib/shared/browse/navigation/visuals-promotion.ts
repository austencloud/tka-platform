 * The publication infrastructure (You-side publish controls, moderation

 * data-layer surfaces. The PUBLIC discovery destination is promoted
 * separately: until the Phase 0B gate calibration says otherwise, production
 * keeps the sequences|collections switcher and unpromoted visuals deep links
 * fall back to Explore > Sequences (the route resolver already parses the
 * full visuals vocabulary, so promotion is a display decision, not a routing
 * one).
