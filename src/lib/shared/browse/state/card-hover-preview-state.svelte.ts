/**
 * Card hover preview state.
 *
 * Exactly one gallery card animates at a time. Cards register their own hover
 * (or a long-press on touch) here and read back whether they're the active one;
 * the animation renders inside that card, so this module owns nothing but the
 * "who's playing" question.
 *
 * A single shared owner rather than a per-card boolean, for two reasons: one
 * AnimationEngine can exist at a time no matter how large the grid is, and a
 * card whose pointerleave never fires (recycled by the virtualizer, pointer
 * yanked off-window) can't strand a second animation running behind the scenes.
 *
 * Cards talk to this module directly rather than through props, so the feature
 * lands on every grid that renders ChoreoCardThumbnail without threading a
 * callback through BrowseGrid, the virtualizer, pickers, and modals.
