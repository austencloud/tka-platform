/**
 * Landing Events
 *
 * Typed `captureEvent` wrappers for the public marketing surfaces — site
 * chrome, the homepage launchpad, and the /composer landing.
 *
 * Why this is separate from `posthog-activity-logger`: that logger is the
 * in-app activity vocabulary. It gates every name against the closed
 * `ActivityEventType` union and remaps a fixed `ActivityMetadata` shape built
 * around sequences, lessons, and modules. Landing surfaces are pre-auth and
 * pre-app-shell — visitors are anonymous, there is no module context, and the
 * properties that matter (cta location, tile id, demo action) have nothing to
 * do with that vocabulary. Forcing marketing events through it would mean
 * polluting the app's event union with names no in-app code ever fires. So
 * these go straight to `captureEvent`, which is where the logger ends up
 * anyway.
 *
 * Every function inherits `captureEvent`'s hard dev gate
 * (`!browser || !initialized || import.meta.env.DEV`). These are deliberate
 * no-ops on localhost — don't add per-function guards, don't work around it.
 *
 * Lives under `$lib` rather than `src/routes/landing/` because the components
 * that fire these (`LaunchpadTile`, `HomeHero`, `SiteHeader`) are themselves
 * lib components, and lib must not import from routes.
 *
 * Spec: docs/architecture/landing-analytics-taxonomy.md
