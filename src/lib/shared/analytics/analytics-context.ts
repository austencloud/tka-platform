/**
 * Analytics Route Context
 *
 * Every custom event in the landing/shop taxonomy carries a `page` property so
 * events segment by surface. That value is always `page.route.id` — the
 * SvelteKit route *pattern* (`/shop/[id]`, `/(public)/composer`) — and never
 * `page.url.pathname`. PostHog already attaches `$current_url` to every event,
 * but that carries query strings and real ids (`/shop/loop-deck-mild?ref=x`),
 * which explodes as a breakdown dimension. Route ids are a bounded set of ~60
 * values that stays bounded as the site grows, so they're the segmentation key
 * and `$current_url` is left for drill-down.
 *
 * Deriving this in one place means the five analytics workstreams can't each
 * pick a slightly different route string.
 *
 * Spec: docs/architecture/landing-analytics-taxonomy.md §2

 * ever fires from the browser, so short-circuit rather than let a stray SSR call
 * site crash a page render. This is an SSR-safety guard, not a dev gate — the
 * dev gating lives in `captureEvent` and stays there.
