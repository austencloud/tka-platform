/**
 * The canonicalizer is PURE — it reads plain sequence data and returns a string
 * hash. It touches no DOM, no storage, no network, so the `browser` guard the
 * other getters in this folder carry never belonged here. It was removed when
 * the combination engine became this module's first real consumer (2026-08-04):
 * with the guard in place the browser took the canonicalizer path while every
 * unit test took the caller's fallback, so the shipped path was the untested one.
