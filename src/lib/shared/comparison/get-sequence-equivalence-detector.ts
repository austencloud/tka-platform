/**
 * Pure equivalence arithmetic over plain sequence data — no DOM, no storage, no
 * network (verified against `services/sequence-equivalence-detector.ts`, whose
 * only value imports are `HandSide` and `isVisibleMotion`). The `browser`
 * guard was dropped with the canonicalizer's (see
 * `get-sequence-canonicalizer.ts`); this getter sits on that dependency chain
 * and carried the same split, where the browser took the real path while every
 * unit test took the caller's fallback.
 *
 * Note for callers: this detector reads `SequenceCanonicalizer`'s hash, which
 * carries three documented defects (cited on `contentDedupKey` in
 * `combination/services/walk-classifier.ts`). Its verdicts are only as sound as
 * that hash — the similarity calculator and the aligner do not depend on it.
