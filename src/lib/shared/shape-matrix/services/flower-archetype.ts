 * The structural minimum this resolver reads off a rotation-style matrix: the

 * Declared here rather than importing lab's `RotationStyleMatrix` so this
 * module keeps the boundary documented in `../README.md` ("Known lab-side
 * dependencies" allowlists two value imports and nothing else). TypeScript is
 * structural, so lab's richer type satisfies this at every call site — and
 * this module states what it actually consumes instead of borrowing a type it
 * does not own.
