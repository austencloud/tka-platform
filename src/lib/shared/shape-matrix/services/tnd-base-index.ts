 * of `build-realization-sequence.ts` so the firebase-free landing hero pool can
 * build the index from statically-baked base words, while the app path keeps
 * loading them from Firestore via `loadBaseIndex` (which re-exports these).
 *
 * The l1-tnd-motions base catalog stores 22 four-beat WORDS, not single letters:
 * same-direction words are 1-letter (AAAA), opposite-direction words are 2-letter
 * (JDJD = split-opp, DJDJ = tog-opp). Mapping each word to its VTG mode (from the
 * seeder's familyId, scripts/seed-tnd-deck.ts) lets a realization resolve by
 * (mode, style pair) instead of by letter — a letter lookup silently dropped
 * every opposite-direction mode because "D" never matched the "DJDJ" key.
