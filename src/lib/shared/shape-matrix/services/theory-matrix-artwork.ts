/**
 * Theory tiles, painted by the Shape Matrix's own painter.
 *
 * The Matrix builds its geometry by realizing a flower as a real TKA sequence
 * and running it through the mandala calculator. A ratio like 4:9 has no
 * sequence to realize — that is the entire reason the Theory surface exists —
 * so its geometry comes from the QfT model instead.
 *
 * Everything downstream of the path stays shared: the same
 * `renderCell` / `renderHeader` guide painter, the same hand colours, the same
 * 2.5px stroke, the same purple overlap, the same extent fit. A Theory tile is
 * a Matrix tile whose curve was computed a different way, which is the point.
 *
 * Each hand is drawn in its own frame, with no pairing in it. That is the
 * Matrix's rule too: a tile is the blue hand's shape against the red hand's,
 * and timing and direction belong to the realization chosen beside the
 * animation rather than to the shape.
