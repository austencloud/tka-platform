/**
 * What the two PROPS are doing to each other at a theory pairing.
 *
 * The element row above the animation names the relationship between the two
 * HANDS. That is only half of a VTG reading, and on the Matrix surface the
 * other half is already on screen: `PropRelationshipChipRow` shows the hand
 * element producing a prop element, because a pair of hands in Split-Same can
 * still be carrying props that are Together-Opposite.
 *
 * The Matrix reads that off a realized sequence's start orientations. A theory
 * ratio has no sequence, which is the whole reason the surface exists, so the
 * bearings come from the same QfT knobs the animation runs on. The three cases
 * and their thresholds stay in `prop-relationship.ts`; this module only says
 * where the bearings come from.
