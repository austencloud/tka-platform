/**
 * The Theory surface's axis vocabulary: the Shape Matrix's own row-and-column
 * idea, carried onto rational prop-to-hand ratios beyond the named turn set.
 *
 * A matrix row is one hand doing one thing. On the Matrix surface that thing
 * is a TKA turn value, which pins the ratio to the turn ladder rather than
 * accepting a fraction directly. Here the ratio is chosen directly, so the
 * same four variants per hand open onto the complete 0–15 ratio field.
 *
 * Timing and direction stay where VTG puts them: BETWEEN the two hands. The
 * QfT model already carries both as knobs (`handPhase`, `handDirection`), so
 * they belong to the pairing rather than to either axis, exactly as split /
 * together / quarter and same / opposite do in the alphabet. The pairing is
 * named by the app's own `VtgMode`, so a Theory pairing and a Matrix cell's
 * realization are the same six things under the same six element names.
