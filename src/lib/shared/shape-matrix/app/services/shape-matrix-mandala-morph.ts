/**
 * shape-matrix-mandala-morph — runs a compact matrix↔detail navigation as a
 * native shared-element transition between the selected tile and the hero.
 *
 * Both compact panes stay mounted. The tile and the hero's cold floor are
 * two instances of ShapeMatrixMandalaArt; whichever pane the layout shows
 * holds the shared `view-transition-name`, so a view change moves the name
 * from one instance to the other and the browser morphs the box between
 * them. This helper owns the three things a plain `startMorph` call misses:
 *
 * 1. the hero floor must be VISIBLE and un-animated at both snapshots
 *    (`beginMandalaHandoff` / `endMandalaHandoff` on the app state);
 * 2. the PanelGroup slide must yield to the morph while it runs — the
 *    `shape-matrix-morph` root class lets the shell suppress that transition
 *    and style the morph's pseudo-elements;
 * 3. fallbacks (no View Transitions API, reduced motion, a morph already in
 *    flight) apply the mutation plainly and still restore the flags.
 *
 * `before` runs — flushed — ahead of the old-state snapshot. Selecting a new
 * tile uses it to make the clicked tile the name holder before the view
 * flips; otherwise the previously selected tile would be captured instead.
 *
 * 4. the destination must be laid out and painted before the new-state
 *    capture. Both compact panes stay mounted, so the pane the view flips
 *    TO was collapsed at 0x0; its tile or floor learns its raster size from
 *    a ResizeObserver, which cannot report while the transition suppresses
 *    rendering. `settleMandalaEndpoint` re-measures every art instance
 *    synchronously (forcing layout), flushes the paint that follows, and
 *    waits for the endpoint's raster to decode, so the browser captures a
 *    full-size picture and the morph is one mandala travelling.
