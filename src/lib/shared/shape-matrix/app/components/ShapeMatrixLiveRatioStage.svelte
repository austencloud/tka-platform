<!--
  The Theory surface's player. It is to Theory what the canonical animation
  canvas is to the Matrix: the same layers, the same controls, the same words
  for them, drawn from a spin ratio instead of from a realized sequence.

  That is the whole reason this file exists rather than mounting the engine.
  The engine animates a sequence: steps, letters, orientations, a word. A
  rational ratio like 4:9 has none of those, and no amount of adapting invents
  them. So the kinematics are local and everything AROUND them is shared. The
  visibility manager decides which layers draw, the effects config decides what
  the tips emit, the effort preset decides how the beat is paced, the tempo
  decides how long a hand cycle lasts. Change any of them on the Matrix and this
  stage has already changed too, because there is one scope behind both.

  Position is EVALUATED from a cycle count, not integrated from a rate. An
  effort curve is not monotonic: elastic and anticipation travel backwards
  before they arrive, so there is no rate to integrate that would reproduce
  them. Evaluating an eased clock gets all eight efforts for free and cannot
  drift.

  The trail keeps exactly one of the hand's own closed paths, and ages in hand
  cycles rather than seconds. A wall clock cannot do that job: the same fourteen
  seconds is a whole 1:2 flower and three fifths of a 1:9 one, and it becomes a
  different fraction again on a 144Hz display. It ages against the RAW clock,
  which is monotonic; only the drawn positions are eased, so a bounce cannot age
  the tail backwards.

  Canvas rather than SVG: the trail is a live ring buffer redrawn every frame
  with a per-segment fade, which is thousands of DOM attribute writes a second
  as SVG and a few hundred cheap strokes as canvas.
