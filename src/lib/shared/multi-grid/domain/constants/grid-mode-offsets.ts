/**
 * GridModeOffsets - Location offsets per grid mode, normalized to radius=1.0
 *
 * Derived from the canonical pixel coordinates in gridCoordinates.ts:
 * - Grid center: (475, 475) in pixel space
 * - Diamond hand points (strict): 150px from center (e.g., east = (625, 475))
 * - Box hand points (strict): ~150px from center at 45° (e.g., ne = (581.1, 368.9))
 * - Outer points: 300px from center (double the hand point radius)
 *
 * Normalization: divide pixel offset by 150 (the hand point radius) to get radius=1.0 units.
 *
 * For the topology system, "hand points" and "outer points" are the same concept -
 * we just use the strict hand point locations as the canonical grid points.
 * The outer points (at 2x radius) are used only for conjoined junction rendering.

 * Diamond mode: hand points at cardinal positions (n/e/s/w)
 * Box mode: hand points at intercardinal positions (ne/se/sw/nw)
 *
 * Both modes share all 9 locations - the distinction is which locations
 * are "hand points" (primary) vs "layer 2 points" (secondary).
 * For topology purposes, all locations are valid placement targets.
 *
 * SVG origin convention: +x = right, +y = down.
 * Cardinal: n=(0,-1), e=(1,0), s=(0,1), w=(-1,0)
 * Intercardinal: at ±cos(45°) ≈ ±0.7071
