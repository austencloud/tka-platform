 * Scale factor that makes a mandala's hand circle line up with the animation
 * engine's hand orbit when the two are stacked in the SAME box.
 *
 * They disagree by construction. The mandala renderer fits its own full extent
 * to its box — `renderScale = size/2 / ((GRID_RADIUS + tipReach) * 1.05)` — so
 * its hand circle lands at whatever fraction is left over once the tips are
 * accounted for, and that fraction MOVES with tipDx. The engine has no such
 * rule: its hand orbit is a fixed 150/950 of the viewBox regardless of prop.
 *
 * So a mandala overlaid at native size reads as a larger, differently-sized
 * orbit than the prop in front of it actually traces. For a staff (dx 126.4)
 * it comes out ~1.6x too big. Multiplying by this factor cancels the mandala's
 * self-fitting and pins its hand circle to the engine's.
 *
 * `dx` cancels out of the tip radius itself; it survives only through the
 * extent the mandala fitted itself to, which is exactly what we're undoing.
 *
 * Only for OVERLAYS. A standalone mandala should keep filling its own box.
