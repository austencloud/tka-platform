 * The center-path angle (RADIANS) for a hand at `location`, i.e. the direction
 * from grid center to the hand, in the engine's convention. Sourced from the
 * canonical `LOCATION_ANGLES` — the same constant the production engine uses to
 * produce `centerPathAngle` — so this never re-derives grid geometry.
 *
 * CENTER resolves to its canonical `LOCATION_ANGLES[GridLocation.CENTER] = 0`
 * directly — oracle-verified (`half-arrow-pipeline.test.ts`, DASH S→N t2): for
 * that halfway `halfwayOrientation === "clock"` and
 * `orientationToStaffAngle("clock", 0) === PI/2 === 90°`, which matches the
 * guide's physical staff angle (`poseAt`) exactly. An earlier revision special-
 * cased CENTER to `centerFallback` (the pre-dash cardinal) purely to preserve
 * pre-dedup behavior; that fallback was wrong by 90° against the ground truth
 * and has been removed for the rotation path. `centerFallback` is kept as a
 * parameter — still used when `location` itself has no `LOCATION_ANGLES` entry
 * — in case a future non-center use needs it.
