/**
 * TKA Supported Prop Types
 *
 * TKA supports both STATIC PROPS (staff, fans, clubs) and MOMENTUM-BASED PROPS (poi).
 * Momentum-based props use physics constraints to limit valid motions and transitions.
 *
 * Static props are held and manipulated directly by the performer.
 * Momentum props swing freely and are affected by gravity.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for ALL prop types in the application.
 * Each enum value corresponds to an available prop SVG file in /images/props/
