 * Props with TWO mirror-symmetric tracked ends — both prop tips trace a tip
 * path in the mandala. Everything else is single-ended: one weighted/grip tip.
 *
 * The staff family is the canonical two-ended prop; buugeng (S-staff), big
 * chicken, big club, doublestar, eightrings, and double contact ball are the
 * other twin-ended, point-symmetric families. As with the chicken family, only
 * the BIG variant is bilateral: regular (small) club and chicken are
 * single-ended — one weighted/grip tip — while big club and big chicken present
 * two symmetric ends (both listed in BIG_BILATERAL_PROPS in
 * prop-classification.ts). Fans, triads, hoops, hands, swords, etc. trace a
 * single tip. Add a prop here only if it genuinely presents two symmetric ends
 * to track.
 *
 * The energy pair splits the same way its parents do: Energy Staff belongs
 * here, Energy Saber does not. Leaving Energy Saber out is load-bearing — the
 * default below is 2, so an omitted single-blade prop would quietly trace a
 * phantom second tip out the back of the hilt.
