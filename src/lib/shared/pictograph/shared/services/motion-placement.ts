/**
 * Motion placement invariants.
 *
 * `MotionData` declares `arrowPlacementData` and `propPlacementData` as
 * non-optional, and the render pipeline enforces that with two hard guards:
 *
 *   - `PictographPreparer.calculateProps` early-returns on a missing
 *     `propPlacementData` (pictograph-preparer.ts) — no prop rendered
 *   - `ArrowLifecycleManager.loadArrowAssets` throws on a missing
 *     `arrowPlacementData`, and the throw is swallowed upstream — no arrow
 *     rendered
 *
 * Both failures are SILENT. A cell missing these fields renders as grid +
 * label with nothing in it, and nothing anywhere says why.
 *
 * Stored data does not always satisfy the invariant. Shortcode/URL-resolved
 * sequences are stored lean, and older Firestore documents carry a
 * `startPosition` that was serialized before the fields existed. Anything read
 * from storage and handed to the renderer has to be re-run through
 * `createMotionData`, which restores the default placement objects (the placers
 * recompute them downstream anyway).
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS: this backfill was written once, inside
 * `navigation/services/sequence-hydrator.ts`, to fix propless cells on /q scan
 * cards (fc1ad42df8). It was never ported to the near-identically-named
 * `foundation/services/sequence-hydrator.ts`, which is the hydrator the
 * browse / library / thumbnail path actually runs — so the same silent bug
 * resurfaced months later as start-position cells rendering with no props
 * across the browse grid, ProfileTabs, the watch feed and the local library.
 * Two copies drifted once; one copy cannot. Import it, do not re-derive it.
