/**
 * view-transition-name-registry
 *
 * The View Transitions API requires every `view-transition-name` to be unique
 * across the whole document at capture time. Two elements sharing a name make
 * the browser abort the transition with:
 *
 *   InvalidStateError: Multiple elements found with view-transition-name: <name>
 *
 * TKA hits this because the same sequence legitimately renders twice at once.
 * The gallery grid card stays mounted underneath the variation picker modal,
 * the "add sequences" sheet stacks a second BrowsePanel over a collection's
 * grid, and so on. Every one of those copies is a ChoreoCardThumbnail asking
 * for `sequence-<id>`.
 *
 * Rather than teach each of the seven-plus hosts which copy is the "real" one,
 * the name itself is claimed. The first element to claim a name holds it; every
 * later claimant renders without a name until the holder releases (unmount, or
 * the card cycling to a different variation). Because overlays mount after the
 * grid underneath them, the holder is always the primary surface — the
 * shared-element morph keeps working on the path that has one, and the extra
 * copies simply do not participate.
 *
 * Plain module state, not a rune: claims are keyed to component lifetime and
 * the grant flows back through a callback, so there is nothing to make reactive.
