/**
 * The one seam for "a filter changed — morph the results grid instead of
 * blinking it".
 *
 * The app disables `::view-transition-old/new(root)` globally
 * (`view-transitions.css`), so a same-document view transition only shows where
 * a NAMED element moves. Every results card already carries a `sequence-<id>`
 * name, which is why wrapping a filter mutation makes the grid rearrange:
 * cards that leave fade out, cards that stay slide into the freed space.
 *
 * Austen (2026-08-05) asked for that motion on EVERY filtering path, not just
 * the value tap it shipped on. The paths live in four different files
 * (GalleryDrill, BrowseModule, BrowseToolbar, BrowsePanel), so the wrapper is
 * here rather than `document.startViewTransition` sprayed across call sites —
 * one seam is what keeps the next path that gets added consistent with these.
 *
 * `withResultsMorph` is inert unless a surface has declared a live results grid
 * (`setResultsMorphActive`). That keeps the shared browse components safe to
 * wrap: on every other host — the grid tab, the filter sheet, narrow phones,
 * the Smart Collection builder — the mutation runs exactly as it does today.
