/**
 * The ghost's annotation vocabulary — the whole contract between the presenter
 * and 26 modules of app (spec: 2026-08-04-ghost-mind-design.md §Safety, §Sensors).
 *
 * Default-deny: the ghost may only press an element carrying
 * `data-ghost="safe"`. Everything unannotated is invisible to it, so a control
 * added next month is safe by default. A blacklist would have the opposite
 * default and would lose.
 *
 * `data-ghost-kind` is the second half: it names the ROLE a control plays, so
 * intentions query one stable vocabulary instead of 26 modules' class names.
 * When a component is refactored the attribute travels with it, which is the
 * whole reason this is an annotation rather than a selector table in a distant
 * file.
 *
 *   <button data-ghost="safe" data-ghost-kind="option">          pressable
 *   <div data-ghost-kind="step-cell" data-ghost-index="3">       readable
 *   <div data-ghost-state="playing">                             sensed
 *   <div data-ghost-linger>                                      worth watching

 * for something with no judgement to press a hundred times while nobody is
 * watching". Everything below stays unannotated ON PURPOSE. Adding an
 * annotation to one of these is a decision to be argued, not an oversight to be
 * fixed:
 *
 *   Writes data      Save / Save to library / Save scene, Favorite, Fork,
 *                    Remix. A jam would end with a library full of a robot's
 *                    half-finished sequences.
 *   Destroys data    Delete sequence, Delete video.
 *   Produces files   Download image / Download Card, video and card export,
 *                    Copy to clipboard. Hundreds of files, and a hijacked
 *                    clipboard on a machine someone else is about to use.
 *   Leaves the app   Share externally (an OS share sheet is not DOM — the
 *                    ghost can neither see nor dismiss it, so the tour dead
 *                    stops), Open TKA, Explore TKA.
 *   Costs money      Uploads, and anything that writes to storage.
 *
 * `clear` is the deliberate exception among destructive controls: it is scoped
 * to the ghost's OWN unsaved work, which is the whole point of a demo that
