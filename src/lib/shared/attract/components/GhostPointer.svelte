  GhostPointer — the attract act's visible "finger", and in presentation mode
  the only body a curious presence has.

  It was a dot with two states: idle, and pressed. That is enough to show WHERE
  a demo is clicking and not nearly enough to read as a someone. Meanwhile the
  mind has been computing a mood on every single decision since it was built,
  and nothing rendered it. This component now does.

  Austen (2026-08-05): "I want him to feel alive ... anybody from afar who's
  watching the program on the projection screen is curious and is drawn in ...
  this thing is a character."

  The vocabulary, in the order it buys life per line of code:

  - CONSIDERING — on target, hovering, not yet committed. The body leans in.
    Set by the motor between arrival and the press. This is the single largest
    "it's alive" tell there is: without it the ghost arrives and fires in the
    same instant, which no hand has ever done.
  - The TRAIL — a wisp behind the dot, length and opacity tracking `speed`. At
    fifteen feet a bare dot changing position reads as a rendering glitch; a
    tail reads as a thing that moved, and it points where it came from.
  - BREATHING at rest, always (it used to be parked-only). A perfectly still
    ghost reads as a frozen app, which is the exact wrong message for a screen
    whose whole job is to look live.
  - MOOD as colour and motion, never iconography. No faces, no emoji: the same
    bar the Taco Cat spec sets for its poses, and the reason this component can
    later be swapped for a character behind an unchanged interface.
  - RECOIL — the press scale releases through an overshooting curve, so contact
    rebounds instead of snapping flat.

  STAGE MODE (`?present=stage`) is the projector case. Every tier in here used
  to key off `min-width: 2600px`, which means a 1080p projector at a jam got the
  laptop treatment — the worst case in the room. Size now comes from an explicit
  flag set once at setup, not from guessing at the viewport.

  Two lifecycle poses survive unchanged:
  - Acting: pure decoration — pointer-events none, aria-hidden.
  - Parked (after takeover): the dot sits in the corner showing a play glyph and
    BECOMES a real button. The ghost is its own "watch it again" affordance.
