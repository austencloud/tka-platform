<!--
  PresenterHost — mounts the ghost mind over the whole app.

  Presentation mode only (`?present=1`). It owns four things and nothing else:
  the ghost's coordinate space, the takeover listener, the route watchdog, and
  the two visible pieces (the pointer and its thought).

  Everything about WHAT the ghost does lives in the intention bag; everything
  about HOW it moves lives in the attract-ghost core. This file deliberately
  knows neither.
