 * dwells with micro-drift, browse-before-pick, the hidden-tab-proof frame
 * loop, and the pause/park/resume lifecycle (takeover glides the ghost to the
 * band's corner where it becomes the clickable "watch it again" button).
 *
 * A section's act is a thin SCRIPT on top: its selectors + a cycle() of
 * personality beats, passed to start(). See construct-attract-act.svelte.ts
