/**
 * invite — "you know you can just take this from me, right?"
 *
 * The presenter demonstrated the app well and never once told anyone they were
 * allowed to touch it. The only affordance was the parked dot, which appears
 * AFTER someone has already grabbed the wheel — no use at all to the person
 * standing back wondering whether the laptop is a video.
 *
 * Austen's ask (2026-08-05): "I want them to know that they can take over at
 * any time, and I want them to know that they can press buttons on the screen."
 *
 * The answer is not a banner. A strip of chrome reading "Live demo — touch
 * anything" sits there for four hours saying the same thing and stops being
 * read within one. An aside from something visibly busy gets read every time,
 * because it arrives as a thought rather than as signage. So the invitation is
 * an intention like any other, and it obeys the same scoring.
 *
 * Three things keep it an invitation instead of a pitch:
 *
 * 1. Appeal 0.10 — it only ever wins when nothing more interesting does.
 * 2. Budgeted and spaced (below), so it is an occasional aside.
 * 3. `calm()` — never over a payoff, an overlay, or a picker. Interrupting the
 *    good bit to advertise is the opposite of drawing someone in.
 *
 * `point-it-out` is the one that actually works on people: it deliberately
 * leaves a specific control hovered and UNPRESSED. An unfinished action is a
 * better invitation than any sentence, because it hands a stranger something
 * concrete to do.
