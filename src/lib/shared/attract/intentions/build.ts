  /**
   * The All / Continuous filter — the worked example of the understanding

   *
   * The domain fact this whole arc turns on:
   *
   *   getReversalCount(option, sequence)
   *
   * Continuity is NOT a property of a letter. It is a property of the
   * transition from where the sequence currently is — the same letter is
   * continuous in one sequence and a reversal in another. That is what makes
   * the toggle confusing (the surviving set changes between steps, which is
   * inexplicable if you think it filters letters) and it is exactly what the
   * realization consists of.
   *
   * So the arc is:
   *
   *   curious    the motive comes from PLAYBACK, not from the picker. Nobody
   *              constrains their option space for fun; they do it after
   *              something felt lumpy and they went looking for why.
   *   confused   forty options became six. "Did I break it?" is the honest
   *              first reaction, and the ghost only says it if the count
   *              really collapsed.
   *   understood met the collapse a second time and the survivors had CHANGED.
   *              Now it is a recommendation, not a restriction.
   *
   * Past `understood`, going back to All means the opposite of what it meant at
   * `confused`: not a panicked retreat but "I want that letter and I'll take
   * the reversal."
