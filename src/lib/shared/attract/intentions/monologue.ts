/**
 * What a person would be thinking when they reach for a particular control.
 *
 * Austen, watching a tour (2026-08-05): *"He sure does say that's a lot of
 * buttons pretty often. Let's make it so he doesn't really do that and before he
 * clicks something let's have him process what he's about to click."*
 *
 * The old thoughts were written per INTENTION, so every effect chip got the same
 * line and every rail item got "What does X do?". The interesting unit is not
 * the intention, it is the CONTROL: pressing Mandala and pressing Tunnel are
 * different curiosities that happen to share a mechanism. So the vocabulary is
 * keyed by kind, with per-label overrides for the controls whose identity a
 * person would actually have an opinion about.
 *
 * Every line here is a MOTIVE — the reason to press it — not a description of
 * the button. "I want to see it from the inside" beats "Open Tunnel view".
 *
 * Lines are drawn with the seeded rng, so a replayed seed replays the monologue.
