/**
 * Sequence persistence normalizer — the one gate an owner sequence passes
 * through before it is allowed to become stored data.
 *
 * Today nothing combines hydration, composition, exact-word validation,
 * canonical length, and identity hash in one place, so each write path solves a
 * different subset and gets a different subset wrong. Three defects in the live
 * corpus trace directly to that:
 *
 *   - `library-repository.ts:708` does `word: sequence.word || metadata.name`,
 *     which is how auto-titles like "Assemble Sequence" became stored WORDS.
 *   - `public-index-syncer.ts:158` does `sequenceLength: sequence.steps?.length ?? 0`,
 *     which is how three live public documents ended up with length 0: an
 *     unhydrated composition-only sequence has no `steps` array at all.
 *   - a partially-resolved word ("GI" from twelve beats) sailed into Firestore
 *     because the permissive display deriver silently drops unlettered beats.
 *
 * This module fixes the shape of the problem rather than each symptom: one
 * normalization, one fixed operation order, one typed refusal.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * No Firestore reads or writes, no UI state, no cache updates, no toasts, no
 * error modals. Pure orchestration over already-shared services, so it is safe
 * to run before a transaction, inside one, or from Admin/Node migration tooling
 * (`npx tsx scripts/migrations/*.ts`). Every dependency below was probed under
 * plain tsx and imports cleanly; see the `stripUndefinedDeep` note for the one
 * primitive that could NOT be imported and why.
 *
 * Timestamps and Firestore `FieldValue` sentinels are deliberately absent from
 * the output. `ownerData` is a plain, sentinel-free domain payload with real
 * `Date`s. Substituting `serverTimestamp()` for `updatedAt`/`createdAt` and
 * bumping `_version` are write-time concerns owned by the repository/persister
 * layer, which must stay usable from migration tooling that does not want live
 * sentinels.

// Normalization

/**
 * Normalize a sequence for persistence, or refuse with a typed error.
 *
 * The operation order is fixed and load-bearing — reordering any pair
 * reintroduces a shipped defect:
 *
 *   1. Hydrate when `steps` are absent — a composition-only document has no
 *      beats to read until it is hydrated. Counting or hashing first is what
 *      produced `sequenceLength: 0`.
 *   2. Strip legacy inline start entries (`stepNumber === 0`) — BEFORE anything
 *      counts, composes, or hashes. Legacy raw-`steps` documents carry the
 *      start position as a letterless step 0; `extractStepPairings` and
 *      `extractSoloProp` map `steps` 1:1, so leaving it in mints a pairing and
 *      a solo-prop beat for a non-beat: `sequenceLength` disagrees with the
 *      word by one, and the next pairings-only republish throws
 *      IncompleteWordError on the letterless leading pairing — a locked
 *      document. The stripped entry's data is not lost: `ensureComposition`
 *      derives `startPosition` from the first content beat's start locations,
 *      which the start entry duplicates by construction. This also normalizes
 *      the V2 content hash to the content-beats-only basis, so a legacy-shape
 *      document and its modern twin share one identity (the hasher maps
 *      `sequence.steps` verbatim; the version-aware lazy-rehash seam absorbs
 *      the correction exactly as it did the V1→V2 flip).
 *   3. Reject empty data — before deriving anything from nothing.
 *   4. Refresh compositional fields from the hydrated sequence — so the stored
 *      composition matches the stored motion data, not a stale earlier edit.
 *   5. Validate one exact token per beat — BEFORE stamping, so a partial word
 *      can never be written. Blank (`isBlank`) steps are refused here too; see
 *      BLANK_STEPS_UNSUPPORTED for why they cannot round-trip yet.
 *   6. Stamp the exact word.
 *   7. Stamp the canonical count — from the persisted source of truth.
 *   8. Hash the normalized data — after every field it covers is final, so the
 *      stored hash describes the stored document.
 *   9. Strip `undefined` last — a cleanup pass, never a validation pass.
 *
 * @throws {SequenceNormalizationError} when there is nothing to persist, or
 *   when the sequence contains blank steps the layer cannot round-trip.
 * @throws {IncompleteWordError} when any content beat resolved no token.

/**
 * Deep `undefined` removal for a validated domain payload.
 *
 * This is NOT a duplicate of `stripUndefined` in
 * `$lib/shared/firestore/firestore-helpers` — it is the same cleanup at a
 * different layer, and it cannot import that one:
 *
 *   1. Layer. The Firestore helper's one distinguishing behavior is preserving
 *      `FieldValue` sentinels (`serverTimestamp()`, `increment()`), which a
 *      normalized owner payload never contains by construction — sentinels are
 *      substituted by the persister AFTER normalization. That helper cleans a
 *      Firestore payload; this cleans validated domain data.
 *   2. Node safety, verified not assumed. Importing it pulls
 *      `firestore-helpers.ts:9` -> `auth/state/auth-state.svelte` ->
 *      `auth/get-user-document-manager` -> `$app/*`. Probed under `npx tsx`:
 *      `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '$app'`. That import would
 *      make this module unloadable from every migration script.
 *
 * Semantics match the canonical helper otherwise: recurse into plain objects,
 * map over arrays, and leave `Date` instances intact (a `Date` has no own
 * enumerable keys, so recursing into one would flatten it to `{}`). Firestore
 * timestamps get converted through their shared `toDate()` contract first.
 * Browser and Admin timestamps are different classes, so an `instanceof`
 * check would protect one write path while leaving the other corruptible.
