/**
 * library-events.ts
 *
 * Lets different parts of the app react when a sequence is added or deleted.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM:
 * The sequence detail panel (the drawer that slides open when you tap a sequence)
 * has a delete button. When you delete a sequence there, any other screen that's
 * showing that same sequence needs to remove it from its list - otherwise the
 * deleted sequence stays visible until the next page refresh.
 *
 * Similarly, the save panel creates new sequences that need to appear in the
 * browse gallery immediately - without a stale cache preventing them from showing.
 *
 * The detail panel / save panel has no direct connection to those other screens,
 * so it can't just tell them directly.
 *
 * THE SOLUTION:
 * The originating panel shouts "a sequence was added/deleted" into a shared channel.
 * Any screen that cares listens to that channel and updates its own list.
 *
 * EVENTS:
 * - tka:library-mutated        - fired after a sequence is deleted
 * - tka:library-sequence-added  - fired after a new sequence is saved
 * - tka:library-sequence-updated - fired after a sequence's metadata changes
 *
 * SCREENS THAT CURRENTLY LISTEN:
 * - browse-state-factory.svelte.ts  - the Browse gallery
 * - SequenceBrowser.svelte (Train)  - the sequence picker in Train mode
 *
 * TO ADD A NEW LISTENER:
 * 1. Call `onLibraryMutated(fn)`, `onLibrarySequenceAdded(fn)`, or
 *    `onLibrarySequenceUpdated(fn)` inside a
 *    `$effect` in your component or state file. The $effect ensures the
 *    listener is cleaned up when the screen is closed.
 *
 *    $effect(() => onLibraryMutated((sequenceId) => removeFromMyList(sequenceId)));
 *    $effect(() => onLibrarySequenceAdded((sequence) => addToMyList(sequence)));
 *
 * 2. Add your file to the SCREENS THAT CURRENTLY LISTEN list above.
