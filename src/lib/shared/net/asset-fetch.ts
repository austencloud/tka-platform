/**
 * Timeout-guarded, lightly-retrying fetch for STATIC assets (letter SVGs, prop
 * SVGs, grid SVGs, placement JSON).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the dev-server "stuck on Loading…" freeze:
 *
 * Heavy routes fire many asset fetches. Each loader previously called raw fetch()
 * with NO timeout. When a socket stalls (server busy compiling under multi-agent
 * churn, or a request queued behind Chrome's 6-connection HTTP/1.1 ceiling) a
 * timeout-less fetch holds that socket OPEN INDEFINITELY. Once enough sockets are
 * wedged the whole tab hangs on "Loading…" forever; refresh reuses the same dead
 * keep-alive pool, so only a brand-new tab recovers.
 *
 * The fix that actually matters is the TIMEOUT: a stalled request aborts after
 * TIMEOUT_MS, freeing its socket, so the browser's own request queue drains and
 * the page self-heals. Chrome already caps concurrency at 6 per origin — a
 * smaller app-side cap only STARVES legitimate parallel work (e.g. the gallery's
 * thumbnail render queue, whose renders then blow past their own 15s budget), and
 * a cap ≥6 is a no-op. So there is deliberately NO concurrency gate here.
 *
 * Retry policy: one retry on a genuine network error ("Failed to fetch" — the
 * transient that a mid-flight HMR reload produces). A TIMEOUT is NOT retried —
 * under a saturated dev server, retrying a timed-out request only adds load and
 * makes the saturation worse. A timed-out asset fails fast; the loader falls back
 * (returns null / loads on demand later).
 */
