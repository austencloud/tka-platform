/**
 * Feature Registry — Compile-Time Feature Gate
 *
 * Single source of truth for which features are enabled in any given build.
 * This file runs at Vite config time (Node.js, not browser) and reads
 * process.env to determine the enabled set. A Vite plugin consumes these
 * exports to stub out disabled feature modules at resolve time.
 *
 * Tiers:
 *   core    — always enabled (create, browse, creators, feedback)
 *   shipped — enabled by default, can be disabled (none yet)
 *   dev     — enabled in dev mode, disabled in production builds
 *   off     — disabled in every build (dev + prod) until explicitly relit
 *
 * Environment overrides:
 *   BUILD_ALL=true          → enable all features
 *   BUILD_<UPPER_ID>=true   → enable a specific feature
 *   BUILD_<UPPER_ID>=false  → disable a specific feature (overrides dev mode)
 *   NODE_ENV !== "production" → all features enabled (dev mode)
 *   Production default: only core + shipped
