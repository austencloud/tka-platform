  SpinnerStepLane.svelte

  The read-ahead lane for the spinner stage: the shared StepStrip carousel,
  sized to HUG its cells.

  Why this exists instead of PracticeLanePane (the other StepStrip wrapper):
  PracticeLanePane pins `fillHeight` on at `(min-width: 768px), (orientation:
  landscape)` — Practice mode's split seam. In fillHeight mode StepStrip caps
  its focus cell at HALF the container height, which is right for a tall
  practice column but means the lane box is always twice its visible band. On
  this page every desktop and landscape viewport hit that branch, so the lane
  read as a filmstrip stranded in an empty box no matter what height it was
  given. Driving cellSize explicitly (fillHeight off) makes the strip report its
  own hugging height instead, which is what lets the stage compose tightly.

  Pure view, same as its sibling: notation cells in, seek callback out. No
  playback ownership.
