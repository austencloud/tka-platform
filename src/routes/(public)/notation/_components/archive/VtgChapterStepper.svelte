<!--
  Vulcan Tech Gospel artifact: VTG 1's five chapters, stepped by hand.

  Two decisions this component exists to hold:

  1. NOTHING ADVANCES ON A TIMER. An auto-crossfade takes the plate away while
     you are still reading it, and these plates take reading. Stepping is an
     action the viewer performs, so the transition can also be an instant cut —
     you chose the moment, so there is nothing to soften.

  2. THE STEPS ARE THE DOCUMENT'S OWN TABLE OF CONTENTS, not a sequence anyone
     here curated. Five chapters, five authors, in VTG V.1's printed order. A
     labelled segmented control keeps chapter navigation visibly distinct from
     the archive's chronological timeline.

  Every plate is cropped from the source PDF. Provenance and quotes:
  ../_lib/vtg-chronicle.ts
