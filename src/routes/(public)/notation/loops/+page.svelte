      A LOOP is a sequence built to come back around: run it out, and the second half
      (or third, or fourth) answers the first under one of six transformations. Mirror
      it, flip it, swap the hands, invert the motions, rewind it, rotate it forward —
      or stack several at once. The chips below build any combination TKA has verified
      and show you a real example, worked out.

      <p>
        The picker composes transforms in one of two ways. A slash, as in
        <code class="inline-tok">Mirrored/Inverted</code>, applies both simultaneously —
        one compound operation. A plus, as in
        <code class="inline-tok">Swapped + Mirrored/Inverted</code>, applies them in
        order: build the inner pattern first, then transform the whole thing with the
        outer one. Order matters —
        <code class="inline-tok">Swapped + Mirrored/Inverted</code> and
        <code class="inline-tok">Mirrored/Inverted + Swapped</code> are different
        sequences, valid from different starting positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        That constraint has a name: the fixed-point theorem. Say the inner pattern runs
        from position S back to S — that's what makes it circular on its own. The outer
        transform then has to take that closed loop and double it without breaking the
        seam, which means the outer transform has to leave S exactly where it is.
        <strong>The starting position has to be a fixed point of the outer transform.</strong>

        Rotated has no fixed point anywhere on the L1-L4 grid — every standard position
        moves when the pattern rotates 180 degrees. That's not a design choice; it's the
        reason rotation can never sit outermost. It only ever works as the innermost
        layer, the thing everything else gets built on top of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beta is the one position every transform agrees on: it's a fixed point for
        Swapped by construction (swapping two hands standing at the same spot changes
        nothing), and it overlaps Mirrored's and Flipped's fixed sets too. That overlap
        is what makes beta the position where the most compositions become legal —
        the universal connector between components.

        Length is a separate question from shape. A LOOP's position period is set by its
        outer transform — two passes for a halved rotation, four for a quartered one. But
        the props also carry an orientation, and orientation has its own period: every
        anti, dash, or hash motion flips it at the base, and turns step it further. If a
        hand's orientation hasn't cycled back to its start by the time the positions have,
        the LOOP keeps running extra passes until it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realized length is the seed multiplied by the least common multiple of those two
        periods — position and orientation. That's why one LOOP type can render at two
        different lengths: same skeleton, but a seed heavy on anti and dash motions
        drifts in orientation even at zero turns, and needs more passes to close the loop
        than a plainer one does.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is a new symmetry — mirror, flip, rotate, swap are old moves. What's
        unformalized is applying them to this particular movement space, and the
        orientation-period structure in particular: TKA hasn't found this worked out
        anywhere else.

        The two ideas overlap in what they're for but not in how they're built. A CAP
        composes per-hand trajectories — lay the left hand's path over the right hand's
        and see how they interlock. A LOOP composes per-beat snapshots — one letter
        already holds both hands, so the composition works on the whole picture at once,
        beat by beat. Parallel concepts, not one contained in the other. CAPs get their
        own full treatment on a dedicated page.
