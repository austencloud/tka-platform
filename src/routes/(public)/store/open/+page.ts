 * app directly, so the Android escape intent routes it through here — a claimed
 * /store/ path — carrying the real destination as ?to=. This restores it.
 *
 * safeInternalPath rejects external and protocol-relative destinations, so the
 * bridge can never be turned into an open redirect. Runs the same on web and
 * inside the app; on web it is simply a redirect.
