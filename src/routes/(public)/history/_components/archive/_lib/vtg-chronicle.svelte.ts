/**
 * The Vulcan Tech Gospel's own chronology.
 *
 * VTG is not one document. It is a continuing project in numbered
 * installments, and VTG 1 is itself five chapters with five different authors.
 * The archive tile steps through those chapters; the detail view tells the
 * chronology.
 *
 * SOURCING — every line here traces to a page that was actually read, on the
 * same terms as `notation-catalog.ts`. Two primaries:
 *
 *   A. https://noelyee.com/vulcan-tech-gospel-1-vtg-1-2011/ — Yee's own
 *      chapter-by-chapter commentary on VTG 1, posted Feb 2, 2019.
 *   B. https://noelyee.com/vulcan-tech-gospel-2/ — the VTG #2 page, carrying
 *      Cantor and Yee's introduction and a dated release log.
 *   Later document, app and social-announcement sources are recorded in
 *   docs/reference/vtg-release-history.md and the archive ledger.
 *
 * The plates themselves were cropped from the PDFs those pages link to.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: any claim that VTG influenced or was influenced by
 * another system in the catalog. Lorq Nichols is credited on the 2015 app
 * alongside Yee, Cantor and Thompson, which is a real documented
 * collaboration — but the archive's rule is that entries state no relationship
 * to one another without Austen's call, so it stays out of the data.
