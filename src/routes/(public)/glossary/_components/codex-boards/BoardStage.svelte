<!--
  Direction C - Index and Stage.

  The rejected board put a 26rem detail panel beside the letters and then
  rendered the detail's variation cells SMALLER than the index cells they came
  from, which makes selecting a letter a downgrade. This fixes that: the index
  is complete - all 47 - and the chosen letter is always on screen beside it at
  several times index size, with no overlay to open and dismiss.

  The index takes the LARGER share on purpose. A first pass gave the stage 78%
  of the band and the index cells measured 46px - a thumbnail nobody can read,
  which is the exact defect this redesign exists to remove. Ten across in 58% of
  the band is legible, packs the 47 into five rows (9+9+10+10+9), and still
  leaves the hero roughly three times any index cell.

  That is the trade: index cells smaller than Atlas's, in exchange for never
  leaving the page to inspect one.
