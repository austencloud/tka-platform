  Composer3DViewerDemo

  The real 3D sequence viewer, live and interactive, embedded standalone on the
  prerendered marketing page. Drag to orbit; it autoplays the sequence carried
  through the page and lets you swap the environment it performs in.

  Standalone recipe (no app shell): provide the mandatory viewer-3d context
  ourselves, plus non-persisting effects + scene-render contexts, then
  enter3D(sequence) — which spins up one performer and loads the sequence onto
  it. Viewer3DCanvas owns its own Threlte Canvas, orbit camera, and scene-
  feature context. This whole stack is heavy WebGL, so the page mounts it
  through LazyMount only when the section nears the viewport.

  Controls are the app's own: SceneControlWorkspace, the same right-hand rail
  every 3D stage in the product carries (sequence viewer, fullscreen, Director).
  It overlays the stage and opens the real Performers, Formation, Camera, and
  Scene tools, so the visitor reaches every environment, count, formation, and
  prop the app has rather than a hand-picked subset of four scenes and three
  counts. Save scene is off: this demo has no collection to save into.

  The viewer is constructed from a complete, non-persisting demonstration seed.
  Scene choices address its own environment state, so this surface never reads
  or writes the visitor's 2D background or saved 3D setup.
