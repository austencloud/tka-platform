# Composer presentation feature truth

**Updated:** 2026-08-21  
**Scope:** Claims considered for the public Composer presentation  
**Rule:** A registry entry is discovery evidence. It is not shipment evidence.

## How a feature earns a status

**Publicly released** means a visitor or ordinary account can reach a working
surface through the current app shell or a public sequence path. Account,
browser, and viewport conditions stay attached to the claim.

**Functional but internal or beta** means a real render or state path works,
but the combined workflow is a test route, operator tool, partial Studio
surface, or production building block. It may guide a demonstration. It may not
be described as an ordinary visitor workflow.

**Incomplete** means a control or screen exists but the promised behavior is
missing, disconnected, or materially narrower than its label.

**Unavailable** means no current user or production path was found. A type,
flag, mockup, or planned spec does not change that.

## Publicly released

| Capability                                         | Conditions and honest public wording                                                                                                                                          | Evidence beyond registration                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Construct a sequence beat by beat                  | Open to guests under Create. “Build a sequence one beat at a time.”                                                                                                           | `CreateModule.svelte` is loaded by `ModuleRenderer.svelte`; `guest-access-config.ts` grants guests the Assemble, Construct, and Generate tabs.                                                      |
| Generate a sequence from choices                   | Open to guests in the full Create module. The unlisted presentation demo proves repeated draws from one prepared recipe, not selectable inputs.                               | `CreateModule.svelte` mounts the real Generate tab. `ComposerGenerateDemo.svelte` calls the current generation orchestrator with fixed inputs and reports no-result draws separately from failures. |
| Play a sequence with pictographs beside the motion | Available in the shared sequence viewer and the real marketing player.                                                                                                        | `SequenceViewerOrchestrator.svelte` mounts the production viewer; `SequenceHeroDemo.svelte` is the working public demonstration.                                                                    |
| Change active prop visuals                         | The current picker includes staff, club, fan, triad, mini hoop, and buugeng. A visual change does not mean every movement transfers safely to that prop.                      | `BentoPropGrid.svelte` renders the active picker sections; `prop-type-manager.ts` prepares and starts live blue/red prop crossfades; the Canvas 2D renderer draws the selected prop assets.         |
| Tunnel view                                        | Working as a live Composer demonstration and in the full app. Do not add mirrors, canons, or per-performer timing unless those controls are shown and verified.               | `ComposerTunnelDemo.svelte` mounts the real tunnel renderer. The Create module also has a routed Tunnel tab.                                                                                        |
| 3D sequence viewing                                | Working with WebGL2 on viewports at least 600px in both directions. The full 3D Studio is not a guest module.                                                                 | `Viewer3DScene.svelte` renders current viewer state; `viewer-modes.ts` and the viewport capability gate decide availability; `guest-access-config.ts` does not grant guests the Stage module.       |
| Community Gallery                                  | Open to guests. Filtering and public sequence viewing are real.                                                                                                               | `BrowseModule.svelte` mounts `GalleryTab.svelte` and the current gallery workspace; guest access explicitly includes Browse > Gallery.                                                              |
| Guest saves                                        | A guest may keep up to three sequences on the current device.                                                                                                                 | `library-save-service.ts` enforces `GUEST_SAVE_CAP`; `guest-access-config.ts` sets that cap to 3 and grants Browse > Library.                                                                       |
| Cloud Library and ordinary collections             | Requires a full account for durable cross-device use.                                                                                                                         | `BrowseModule.svelte` mounts `MyCollectionsPanel.svelte`; the collection state and library repository back its working add, remove, and detail paths.                                               |
| Smart Collections                                  | Requires a full account. Describe them as rule-based saved filters, not as AI.                                                                                                | `BrowseModule.svelte` mounts `SmartCollectionSaveDialog.svelte`; the gallery drill supplies the live rule catalogue and collection results.                                                         |
| Image and animation-video downloads                | Visitors can configure and preview; downloading requires a full, non-anonymous account.                                                                                       | `export-coordinator.svelte.ts` gates both delivery paths through `ensureFullAccountForExport`; the current image and video exporters create the files.                                              |
| QR on eligible image exports                       | Signed-in users can choose QR for the eligible image info cell. It is optional and is not present on every export.                                                            | `ExportImagePanel.svelte` exposes QR only when authenticated; `info-cell-display.ts` suppresses guest QR and resolves competition with the mandala cell.                                            |
| Follow and unfollow creators                       | Requires sign-in. Following people is working; a personalized sequence feed is a different claim.                                                                             | `CreatorsPanel.svelte` and `UserProfilePanel.svelte` call the transactional `followUser` and `unfollowUser` repository paths and update the visible state.                                          |
| Arcade games                                       | Available through Learn > Play for an account with module access. The routed shell currently mounts ten game components, so the claim does not rest on `GAME_REGISTRY` alone. | `LearnTab.svelte` mounts `PlayHub.svelte`; `GameShell.svelte` imports and routes the ten current game components, including Word Bridges and Trace Paths.                                           |
| Install as a browser app                           | Keep only if the production manifest, service worker, and install prompt pass the release verification for the target browser.                                                | The PWA files provide an implementation path, but this claim still needs a production install test before final copy approval.                                                                      |

## Functional but internal or beta

| Capability                               | What works                                                                                                            | Why it is not a public promise yet                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-performer Stage timing and marks   | Stage choreography can assign performer marks and per-performer sequence clips.                                       | `StageViewer.svelte` still supplies the default avatar, staff props, and `showEffects={false}`. The complete per-performer Studio story is not connected in that surface. |
| Deterministic high-resolution 3D capture | `offline-3d-exporter.ts` steps synthetic time, interpolates camera keyframes, and captures at fixed frames.           | It is an export building block, not a public multi-shot film editor.                                                                                                      |
| Camera choreography presets              | Current shot helpers include orbit, plane, reveal, and ensemble framing.                                              | The public recording chrome currently exposes Free Camera and Auto Orbit rather than the whole preset set.                                                                |
| Broad 3D effect set                      | The current 3D effects layer has working render paths for fire, LED, trails, bubbles, electricity, and other effects. | Effect capabilities differ. Whole-rig control and effect-specific gaps mean the page should show approved examples, not promise identical controls for all effects.       |
| Advanced experiments in Lab              | Some labs are functional enough for operator use.                                                                     | Lab is admin-only and its module definition explicitly calls it temporary experiments and prototypes.                                                                     |

## Unlisted presentation proof

These rows describe `/composer/mockup`. They prove the compact product story but
do not promote the route or replace the public `/composer` page.

| Proof                            | What the mockup demonstrates                                                                                                     | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guided step-by-step construction | A visitor can watch or take over a real build as each chosen pictograph becomes the next beat and carries into every demo below. | `ConstructSection.svelte` composes the production start picker, `OptionPicker`, `StepGrid` arrival stage, and existing ghost attract act around isolated presentation state. |
| Prepared generator draw          | Each click asks the production orchestrator for a fresh 16-beat sequence from the same disclosed recipe.                         | `ComposerGenerateDemo.svelte` fixes the inputs, distinguishes no result from load or engine failure, and carries successful output into the tunnel and 3D viewer.            |
| Isolated live 3D controls        | Scene, performer count, and staff or club controls change a deterministic one-performer Cosmic seed without account writes.      | `composer-3d-demo-state.ts` supplies the complete seed; `composer-presentation-viewer-isolation.test.ts` proves saved 3D values remain byte-identical.                       |
| Accessible moving demonstrations | Primary motion has 48px keyboard controls and starts paused under reduced motion; WebGL2 absence has an announced fallback.      | The route forwards canonical player controls, names every segmented group, and gates `Composer3DViewerDemo.svelte` through the shared WebGL2 and viewport capabilities.      |
| Real gallery shelf               | The carried sequence renders as a real gallery card beside public sequences loaded from the live Community Gallery.              | `ComposerGalleryShelf.svelte` composes `ChoreoCardThumbnail` (read-only) over `PublicSequencesLoader` data; nothing is written, and gallery load failure shows an inline retry. |

## Incomplete

| Capability or claim                              | Evidence of the gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Composer presentation decision                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Distinct Train practice modes                    | Adaptive, Step by Step, and Timed appear in the picker and have configuration state. `TrainModePanel.svelte` receives `practiceMode` and `modeConfig` but its playback and scoring path does not use them to create distinct behavior. | Do not say “practice modes” are fully live. A narrower “camera practice workspace” claim needs its own runtime proof. |
| “Their new sequences surface when you come back” | Follow relationships and a Following creator roster exist. No personalized sequence-feed query or surface was found.                                                                                                                   | Say “follow creators” only. Remove feed behavior and “the list ends” until a working surface exists.                  |
| Fully configurable multi-performer Stage         | The Stage module is routed, but `StageViewer.svelte` hardcodes default avatars, staff props, and disabled effects.                                                                                                                     | Treat Stage choreography as beta and show only the combinations that are actually wired.                              |

| QR on every export                                   | Video export does not carry this image info cell, guests cannot mint the QR, and eligible images make it optional.                                           | The old “every export” sentence is false.                                                     |
| Full movement equivalence across every prop          | The current movement model begins with double staves. Momentum props, tosses, contact rolling, and grip changes are not represented as equivalent transfers. | Keep the limitation beside any prop list.                                                     |
| Eight-performer beat ripple in the general 3D viewer | `Viewer3DScene.svelte` drives the performers from the same current step; the two-avatar sync helper does not provide the proposed eight-person timeline.     | New film-director or Studio timing work is required.                                          |
| Multi-shot 3D film director                          | Camera recording and fixed-frame export exist, but no current timeline stages complete shots, cuts, and crossfades.                                          | Govern new work with `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-composer-3d-showcase-film-design.md`. |
| Astronaut or zombie performer                        | Neither appears in the deployed avatar set, effort types, or effects.                                                                                        | New compatible assets or motion work must be approved before marketing uses them.             |
| Performer elevation or pedestal control              | No current standalone viewer path was proven for per-performer elevation.                                                                                    | Omit or build the real capability first.                                                      |
| 3D on every device                                   | The current viewer requires WebGL2 and hides below the minimum two-dimensional viewport.                                                                     | Always provide a poster or 2D fallback.                                                       |

## Verdict on the old “Also in the app today” block

The block cannot survive as written.

- Community Gallery is released.
- Image and video download are released with a full-account condition.
- QR is optional on eligible signed-in image exports, not on every export.
- Library and Smart Collections are released with account and durability
  conditions.
- The six named prop visuals are valid, with the movement-transfer limit.
- The arcade is routed and functional, but it is a Learn story rather than a
  reason to lengthen the Composer page.
- The three named practice modes do not yet have three distinct working
  behavior paths.
- Installation needs a production-browser proof before the copy is approved.

The focused mockup is right to remove this catalogue. Released features can
appear when they complete the Composer story. The rest belongs on its own
product surface, in a truthful support page, or nowhere yet.
