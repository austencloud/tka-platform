/**
 * composer-launchpad-tiles.ts — the composer bento launchpad's tile defs +
 * target manifest (spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-composer-launchpad-morph-design.md §4).
 *
 * Two exports:
 *   - COMPOSER_TILES: 9 per-section tiles (16 grid cells) for the decoupled
 *     LaunchpadGrid (`variant="composer"`). Every tile is `activate: true`, so
 *     the grid renders each primary control as a <button> that fires
 *     `onActivate(tile)` (opening the dive/takeover) instead of navigating.
 *     Tinted by the five wing colors from /composer's wing bands.
 *   - COMPOSER_TARGETS: the expand target manifest keyed by tile id. Each entry
 *     is a CLIENT-ONLY dynamic import of the rich section (or Outputs demo) the
 *     dive full-bleeds into, plus `needsDemoSeq` — true only for the two targets
 *     that take a runtime SequenceData (Tunnel + 3D).
 *
 * Import discipline (spec §8, zod trap): the loaders are lazy `() => import()`
 * arrows — never top-level static imports — so importing THIS module pulls in
 * only the array + manifest object. The heavy pictograph graph (special-arrow-
 * placement → zod) is dragged in only when a loader is actually invoked,
 * client-side, through LazyMount. That keeps the module node-safe to import and
 * the /composer prerender clean. Preview media follows the same rule via
 * LaunchpadTile's own LazyMount branches.
