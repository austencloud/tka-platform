   * tkaflowarts.com/support — the "buy me a coffee" page.
   *
   * A general support page for the whole Kinetic Alphabet project, not just the
   * guide: the printed Level 1 guide carries ONE QR that points here, and the
   * site header links here too, so it has to read for someone who arrived from
   * the book AND for someone clicking "Support" in the nav. Stripe Checkout also
   * redirects back HERE (not the in-app modal) on success/cancel.
   *
   * The donation card itself lives in the shared SupportContent component, so
   * this route and the in-app SupportModal render the exact same UI from one
   * source. This route owns only the viewport-fit sizing of the card; the
   * cosmic background, SiteHeader AND SiteFooter all come from the persistent
   * MarketingChrome (root layout). The Stripe-return status banner is
   * route-only (the modal never receives the redirect).
