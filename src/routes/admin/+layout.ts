/**
 * Admin Route Guard
 *
 * Client-side guard that prevents non-admin users from loading admin pages.
 * Waits for Firebase Auth to initialize, then checks admin status.
 * Redirects non-admins to the home page.
 *
 * Note: This is a defense-in-depth measure. All admin operations are also
 * protected server-side by Firestore rules and API endpoint guards (requireAdmin).
