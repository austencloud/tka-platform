   * Walk lab
   *
   * One performer, one floor, and every way of walking across it, so the thing
   * the eye is complaining about can be reproduced on demand instead of caught
   * in passing in the middle of a film.
   *
   * The rig is the shipping one: PerformerRig with locomotion and foot
   * planting on, the same component the sequence viewer and the film director
   * mount. The only thing the lab supplies is where to go, which is the one
   * input a scene normally buries inside choreography.
   *
   * The instrument beside it is the gait probe, which samples the pose after
   * the whole pipeline has written it and says what the legs actually did.
   * Its teleport row is the one to read first: a joint arriving somewhere in a
   * single frame instead of travelling there is the shape of the complaint,
   * and the strip underneath lines each one up against what the feet were
   * doing at that moment.
