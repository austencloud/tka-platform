 * pick a winner, and either choice silently discards what the director wrote.
 *
 * Two-layer validity contract for every `durationBeats`/`atBeats` field: this
 * schema only bounds beats SYNTACTICALLY (e.g. scene durationBeats is
 * positive and capped at 240, transition durationBeats at 32) — those caps
 * are generous enough to admit values that convert to an out-of-range

 * scene's 1-60s window, the transition's 0-3s window) is enforced at resolve
 * time by `convertSceneBeatTimes` (director-beat-times.ts), once the scene's
 * bpm is known. `schema.parse` succeeding is therefore necessary but not
 * sufficient for a beats-stated field to be valid — resolution can still
 * reject it.
 *
 * Named `atMostOneTimeUnit` (not `exactlyOne`) because both fields are
 * optional-with-a-computed-default: stating neither is fine (something else
 * supplies the duration), only stating BOTH is the contradiction. This is the
 * opposite of `cameraKeyframeSchema`'s inline `atSeconds`/`atBeats` check
 * further below, which requires EXACTLY one — a keyframe has no default
