/**
 * Every capability the director language offers, enumerated for a reader.

 * The films answer "what can this do?" one scene at a time, over minutes. This
 * answers it at a glance: what the axes are, how many values each one has, and
 * which scene in the loaded film proves it. Nothing here restates a value list.
 * Every count and every label is read from the registry or enum that the
 * resolver and the schema themselves read, so a capability cannot appear here
 * that a film would reject, and one cannot be added to the language without
 * appearing here.
