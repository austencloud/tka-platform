/**
 * Resolves each performer's directed sequence into real SequenceData.
 *
 * The film schema lets a performer say what they spin — the shared demo, a
 * directed sequence, a saved library sequence, or another performer's
 * sequence changed by a chain of transforms (`mirrorOf` being the one-word
 * spelling of a single mirror). Generating, loading, and transforming are all
 * async, so this sits between the synchronous spec resolver and the location:
 * the scene asks for a scene's sequences, gets whatever has resolved so far,
 * and re-applies once the rest land.
 *
 * Everything is cached by what it is rather than by who asked for it, so two
 * performers who directed the same sequence share one generated result, and a
 * given transform chain of it runs once no matter how many performers ask.
 *
 * Dependencies are injectable so the chain logic is testable without the
 * generation orchestrator, Firestore, or the motion-query singleton; the
 * defaults are the production owners.
