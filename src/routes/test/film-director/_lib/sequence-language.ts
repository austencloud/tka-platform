/**
 * What a performer spins, in the words a director uses.
 *
 * "DJ, starting at beta at South, one turn every step" is four separate
 * generator inputs. This is where the spoken form becomes the
 * `GenerationOptions` the Create module's orchestrator already runs.
 *
 * The schema shapes these directives; meaning is checked here, the same split
 * `blocking-language.ts` uses. A wrong grid location or an impossible turn
 * gets a sentence naming the catalog, which a zod union cannot produce.
 *
 * Every axis here was traced to a `builder.build()` call before it was
 * offered. `GenerationOptions.propContinuity` reads like the prop-continuity
 * knob and reaches neither call — `flow` maps to `constraintPreset`, which is
 * the one that arrives.
