/**
 * The staging behind every capability demo, one scene per thing the director
 * language can say.
 *
 * These were the scenes of a film called Proving Grounds, which ran three and a
 * half minutes and asked to be watched end to end before it answered anything.
 * Nobody wants a film to find out whether the camera can leave the tripod. The
 * scenes stayed; the film did not. `_capabilities/index.ts` wraps each one as a
 * demo that plays on its own, and owns the name and the single line that says
 * what it shows.
 *
 * Nothing here is user-facing text. A scene is staging: where the bodies are,
 * what is in their hands, what the camera does, and how long it lasts. Scene
 * ids are the stable address — array order is not, and nothing may refer to a
 * scene by its position.
 *
 * Two scenes only mean something with a partner, and their demos carry both:
 * `tempo-double` continues the phrase `tempo-slow` started, and `callback`
 * extends `combined-draw` and re-draws its seed.
