 * Every capability the director language offers, one demo each.
 *
 * This replaced a library of nine films. The films proved the language and then
 * kept charging for it: finding out whether the camera can leave the tripod
 * cost a three and a half minute watch, or knowing that Proving Grounds scene
 * eleven was the one. A capability is now its own document with one scene in
 * it, so picking it plays it, on a loop, and nothing else.
 *
 * `id` is the address (`?film=<id>`) and the scene id it wraps. `demonstrates`
 * is the whole description: one line, read in a glance, no paragraph behind it.
 * If a capability needs more than a line to say what it shows, the demo is
 * doing two things and should be two demos.
 *
 * Staging lives in `./scenes`. Nothing here restates it.

/**
 * Shared across every demo, because none of them is a film with a look of its

 *
 * `base` is stated rather than left to default, and that is load-bearing. The
 * default is `hashString(film.id)`, which would give each demo its own stream
 * family and make a scene's draw depend on which document happens to wrap it —
 * so `combined-draw` would deal one set of planes in its own demo and a
 * different set as the callback's establishing shot. Naming the base pins the
 * draw to the scene, which is the unit now. The `rightPlane` salt is tuned
 * against this base: it lands `combined-draw` a draw with no cross-axis
 * repeats, so its frame shows six visibly different planes.
