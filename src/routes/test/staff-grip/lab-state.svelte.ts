/**
 * The lab's state IS its URL.
 *
 * Every axis a person can change here — the character, the prop, the prop
 * length, the sequence, where in that sequence we are, whether it is running,
 * which cameras are up, which inspector is open — lives in the query string.
 * Copying the address bar and pasting it somewhere else reproduces the exact
 * moment, which is the only way a cross-body / cross-prop finding can be
 * handed to another person without a paragraph of setup instructions.
 *
 * One direction of flow: the URL is read into derived values, and every
 * setter writes the URL. Nothing keeps a private copy of an axis, so the two
 * can never disagree. `phase` is the single exception and it is explained on
