/**
 * The lab's goal list: the 19 core TnD sequences.
 *
 * These are ids 1-19 of `TND_MOTIONS` in `scripts/seed-tnd-deck.ts`, the deck
 * the `l1-tnd-motions` catalog ships, and the corpus
 * `docs/diagnostics/prop-continuity-findings.json` was swept against. The lab's
 * target is a teleport-free pass across all nineteen, so they are the thing the
 * controls pin — not an ad-hoc pick of demo fixtures.
 *
 * The roster below is data, but it is not a second source of truth. The seeder
 * remains the authority, and `tests/unit/3d-animation/staff-grip-goals-contract.test.ts`
 * fails if this list, the baked catalog, and the seeder ever disagree on a
 * playback-relevant field.
 *
 * VTG groups these by hand-path timing (split / together / quarter) and hand-path
 * direction (same / opposite); the labels come from `TND_FAMILIES` in the seeder.
