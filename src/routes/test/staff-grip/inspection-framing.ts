/**
 * Camera framing for the staff-grip inspection lab.
 *
 * The four panes are one set: every camera aims at a named anatomical region
 * whose size comes from the performer's own proportions, so the panes share a
 * scale relationship and none of them moves while the phase slider does. The
 * pose is deliberately not an input here — a camera that chases the palms
 * re-frames itself on every settle frame, which is what made the old lab hard
 * to read.
 *
 * The distance solve itself lives in `../_lab-kit/inspection-shot`, which the
 * reach lab shares. This module owns what is specific to THIS lab: which
 * anatomical regions it frames, and the four panes it puts them in.
 *
 * `$lib/shared/3d/camera/compute-framing-shot` stays the owner of "fit N
 * performers plus their prop clearance in frame" and is used by the quiz, play
 * preview, and film-director surfaces. It is deliberately not used here: it
 * bakes in a 1.2 m per-performer horizontal extent and a 2 m minimum distance,
 * and this lab frames a region (a grip zone at roughly 1.3 m of frame height)
 * rather than a performer.
