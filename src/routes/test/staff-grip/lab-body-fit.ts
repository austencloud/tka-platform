/**
 * What this body can hold, next to what it is actually holding.

 * fails in a way that neither the rig nor the staff shows on its own, so the
 * two numbers have to sit side by side.
 *
 * Every measurement here comes from `shared/3d/domain/performer-reach-
 * measurements.ts`. This module only feeds the live skeleton readings into
 * that owner and formats what comes back; it derives no anthropometry of its
