 * Every effect in the registry, laid out as a 4x4 grid of stations.

 * The registry holds exactly sixteen effects, which is why the grid is 4x4 and
 * not a scrolling list — the whole system fits in one frame, which is the point
 * of the page. If an effect is ever added or removed, GRID_COLS below is the
 * only thing to revisit.
 *
 * Every cell runs the SAME sequence with the SAME overlaid rig arrangement, so
 * the only variable across the grid is the effect itself. That is what makes it
 * a comparison rather than a gallery.

 * third of the frame empty on each side. Spreading X fills the canvas without
