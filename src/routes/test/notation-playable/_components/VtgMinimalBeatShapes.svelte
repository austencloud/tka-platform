<!--
  Vulcan Tech Gospel artifact: the notation as VTG actually wrote it.

  This tile used to draw TKA mandalas, which made the most important system on
  the page look like every other system on the page. It isn't. VTG wrote its
  1:1 set in a flat 2D language of overlaid ellipses — GREEN for spin, RED for
  antispin — and that language is the thing worth showing.

  The ten shapes here are lifted directly from Vulcan Tech Gospel V.1 page 2,
  "10 Minimal Beat Shapes" by Brian Thompson (the PDF Noel Yee publishes at
  noelyee.com). Each glyph was cropped from the page at 6x, keyed to
  transparency, and — critically — cropped to ONE shared box, so the printed
  size relationships survive: an isolation really is a dot next to a full-size
  extension. Normalising each glyph to fill its own tile would throw that away,
  and the size relationship is part of the notation.

  The page's own argument is the layout: four base shapes, and the six hybrids
  they stack into. Names and the header sentence are quoted verbatim.
