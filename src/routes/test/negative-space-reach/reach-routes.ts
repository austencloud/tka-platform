/**
 * The two routes through one wall-plane reach, as notation.
 *
 * `docs/reference/negative-space-and-wall-plane-reach.md` describes ONE motion
 * of ONE hand taken two ways: the right hand starts at the North point holding
 * the staff thumb-end-in and finishes at East thumb-end-out, and the performer
 * either sends the thumb end "through the pocket above my shoulder and behind
 * my forearm" (§4) or lets it "push downstage of the forearm" (§5). The
 * document is explicit that the two "take the same hand from the same start to
 * the same notated end point".
 *
 * Two prop paths satisfy that notation, and only two. The hand walks a 90°
 * arc; thumb-in to thumb-out is a 180° change in which end faces the centre; so
 * the staff either rotates 90° against the hand (anti, zero turns) or 90° with
 * it plus a half turn (pro, one turn). Those are Δ and Σ, and both are literal
 * rows of `static/data/pictographs/DiamondPictographDataframe.csv` sharing an
 * identical static left hand:
 *
 *   Δ,alpha1,gamma11,none,none,static,noRotation,s,s,anti,ccw,n,e
 *   Σ,alpha1,gamma11,none,none,static,noRotation,s,s,pro,cw,n,e
 *
 * Every other axis is held still, so prop rotation is the only variable
 * between the two panes.
 *
 * **This module does not claim which encoding is §4 and which is §5.** That is
 * open question 3 of the document ("Whether the two routes are a performer's
 * choice or determined by entry orientation, target, plane, or turn count"),
 * and the page answers it by measuring where the rig actually puts the thumb
 * end rather than by labelling a pane. What is asserted here is only that these
 * are the two prop paths the notation admits.
 *
 * End orientations are DERIVED through the production calculator rather than
 * typed in, so a fixture cannot quietly disagree with the orientation rules the
 * rest of the app runs on.
