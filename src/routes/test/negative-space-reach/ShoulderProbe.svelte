   * Where the right shoulder actually is, this frame.

   * The pose diagnostics the performer publishes carry the elbow, the wrist,
   * the palm and the shoulder WIDTH, but not the shoulder's world point:
   * `BodySnapshot.rightShoulder` exists inside the scene package and is not
   * among the values handed to `onCollisionEvents`. Three of the document's
   * measurements are anchored on that joint — whether the thumb end is above
   * the shoulder, how far past the shoulder's own frontal plane it travels,
   * and how much of the arm's length is spent — so without it the lab would be
   * reporting a guess and calling it a finding.
   *
   * This reads the bone off the rendered scene graph instead, which is the same
   * thing `GaitProbe` does for legs and for the same reason: what matters is
   * where the joint ended up after the animator, the IK and the arm solve have
   * each had their turn, not what any one of them intended.
   *
   * It renders nothing and writes nothing back into the scene.
