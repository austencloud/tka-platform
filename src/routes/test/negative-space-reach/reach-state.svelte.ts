/**
 * The reach filmstrip's state IS its URL.
 *
 * Every axis a person can change — the body, which frames are shown, which
 * route, which camera angle, whether the measurement overlay draws, whether
 * the full readouts panel is open — lives in the query string, so a finding
 * can be handed over as a link instead of a paragraph of setup instructions.
 *
 * One direction of flow: the URL is read into derived values and every
 * setter writes the URL, so the two can never drift apart. Every frame here
 * is a FROZEN pose rather than a moving clock, so — unlike the scrubbing lab
 * this page used to be — nothing needs the coalesced-write/local-mirror
 * treatment `phase` used to get. That machinery is gone with it.
