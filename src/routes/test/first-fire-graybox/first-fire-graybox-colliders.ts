 * Collision for the isolated review shell.
 *
 * This builds the outer envelope only: the floor, the four room walls with
 * their two door gaps, and a stop a little beyond each door so the review walk
 * ends at the threshold instead of in the void. The rock inside that envelope
 * collides as the carved mesh - see `first-fire-shell-collider` - so a wall
 * that the carve removed stops blocking the moment it stops being drawn.
 *
 * It used to also emit one upright box per edge of every basalt mass's authored
 * polygon. Those polygons are the rock's silhouette BEFORE the courts and
 * corridors were cut from it, and no basalt mesh is exported at all
 * (`basaltMassesBuiltAsGeometry: 0`), so those colliders sealed chambers that
 * the visitor could plainly see were open. Removed 2026-08-10; the shell mesh
 * is the only description of where the rock is.
 *
 * Every fire guide remains intentionally walk-through.
