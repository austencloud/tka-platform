  /**
   * Coal dressing for the first section of the walk: Water door, threshold,
   * the water-to-dj transfer, and the approach into the DJ court.
   *
   * Placement is DERIVED from the approved contract, never eyeballed. The
   * corridor centreline and width come out of pathSections, the threshold out
   * of contract.threshold, the court out of contract.courts. Nothing here
   * moves a wall or a route - it only decides what the visitor sees standing
   * on geometry the plan already fixed.
   *
   * The vocabulary is the one the look-dev room settled:
   *   - banked coal cribbing as the wall treatment
   *   - chain lamps marking the route
   *   - a quench vent where the walk arrives from Water
   *
   * The quench vent is doing double duty. Austen's brief asks for a thread
   * connecting the exhibits, and this is the one place in the museum where two
   * rooms physically meet: a visitor steps out of Water and the first thing
   * this room does is put their element on hot slag and boil it off. The
   * transition IS the exhibit label.

   * ===== The composition =====

   * The route is four straight legs, measured off the contract:
   *
   *   leg A   0.00 - 7.00m   Water door to the bend. Visitor spawns at 2.0m.
   *   leg B   7.00 - 12.00m  the diagonal
   *   leg C  12.00 - 14.06m  the short jog
   *   leg D  14.06 - 15.86m  the turn into the DJ court
   *
   * It gets THREE dressed events, one per leg, and no leg carries two.
   *
   *   3.75m  the quench vent, on the threshold. Arrival from Water.
   *  10.00m  the fuel bank, past the bend.
   *  13.20m  one chain lamp, at the court mouth.
   *
   * The spacing is set in ELEVATION, not in plan. An earlier pass spaced these
   * on the floor plan, called 6m "far apart", and shipped an arrival frame
   * holding the vent, both lamps, the crib and the torch lane at once: leg A is
   * straight, 7m long, and the visitor spawns at 2.0m, so everything from the
   * threshold to the bend is one sightline. Distance down a straight corridor
   * does not separate two things - it stacks them. What separates them is the
   * bend, so each beat now sits on its own leg and the visitor has to walk to
   * earn the next one.
   *
   * Leg A therefore holds exactly one lit object, at ankle height, and nothing
   * else. That is the whole point of the arrival: the room should read dark,
   * warm and deep before it reads decorated, and a visitor who steps out of
   * Water into a full frame has nowhere left to go.
   *
   * The fuel bank is ONE 3.4m cribbing run on the LEFT only, sitting inside
   * leg B's 5m so a rigid straight run never punches the wall on a bend. One
   * lit side and one dark side is a composition; two lit sides is a tunnel of
   * orange. It is also the honest read - fuel gets stacked where there is room
   * to stack it, not wrapped around a corridor like tile.

   * middle of the walkway is not decoration, it is an obstacle, and one at the

   * brightest element before they have taken a step.
   *

   * direction and a lit court at the end of it. So the lamp stops being a
