   * Gate 3 environment pass for The Cinder Court. Each court is its own
   * environment rather than one treatment repeated three times, composed from
   * the existing ember scene components instead of re-deriving volcanic
   * shading here.
   *
   * The through-line is one volcano read vertically - magma chamber, then the
   * burn, then the eruption column - documented in first-fire-court-identity.
   *
   * Two hard constraints from the Gate 3 spec:
   *
   * 1. Every photon comes from something burning. There is no ambient fill and
   *    no sky dome, so `lit` can take the room to true black at the
   *    extinguish beat. VolcanicHaze stays unmounted for that reason: it is an
   *    inward-facing additive sphere, which is a sky.
   * 2. Fire never owns collision. Everything here is visual-only; the collider
   *    set in first-fire-graybox-colliders.ts is untouched.
