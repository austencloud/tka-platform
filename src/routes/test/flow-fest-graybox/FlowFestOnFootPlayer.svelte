   * the moment you stepped off. Third person needs something behind the
   * camera at all times, so this is the on-foot half of that.

   * contacts, and IK all stay with the scene package's locomotion animator.
   * This component only converts the walk scene's body-centre physics
   * position into the character's foot position and reports movement.

  `isActive` stays false on purpose. The scene package puts an active
  avatar on LAYER_PLAYER_BODY, which exists to hide your own body from a
  first-person camera - exactly the body a chase camera has to see. The
  mounted rider and every NPC render on LAYER_WORLD for the same reason.

  `avatarId` is the scene package's historical vocabulary. Passing it here
  is the one sanctioned boundary; everything above this line says character.
