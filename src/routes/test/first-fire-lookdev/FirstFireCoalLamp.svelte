   * Coal lamp - look-dev study.
   *
   * A soot-blackened iron hood on a dungeon chain, holding a bed of live coals
   * that spill as it swings. It is proposed as the connecting thread across all
   * three First Fire courts: the same fixture, the same chain, different thing
   * burning inside it, marking the route the visitor walks.
   *
   * This is a study, not the shipping asset. Its job is to answer whether the
   * silhouette reads at walking distance and whether coals in a hanging basket
   * light the space usefully. Once the proportions are chosen, the fixture is
   * authored in Blender and exported to GLB per blender-first-3d-scenes.md -
   * procedural primitives are not how static set dressing ships here.
