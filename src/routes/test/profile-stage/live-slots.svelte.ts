/**
 * LiveSlots — the liveness coordinator prototype from
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-profile-as-stage-design.md`.
 *
 * Every expensive tile on the profile registers here with its medium. One
 * IntersectionObserver tracks which tiles are on screen; on every scroll frame
 * the visible tiles are ranked by distance from the viewport centre and the
 * top N per medium are granted a live token. Everything else renders its
 * poster.
 *
 * Single owner by design. Three bands each running their own observer would
 * race for the GPU — the archive band alone can register hundreds of tiles,
 * and `activate-when-near` is one-shot (activate, never revoke) so it cannot
 * express a budget that has to be handed back on scroll.
 *
 * Tiles receive their status through a callback rather than reading a reactive
 * map: a Map keyed by element would re-run every tile's effect on every scroll
 * frame, which is exactly the cost this class exists to bound.
