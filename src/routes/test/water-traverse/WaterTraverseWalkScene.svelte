  /**
   * The Water Traverse — graybox.
   *
   * ── What this file is for ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * ONE question: is the box right? Does the walk pace well, is everything the
   * size it should be, do the walls contain, do the chambers actually join, is
   * the floor continuous, is there a ceiling overhead, and can you tell where to
   * go without being told. Nothing else.
   *
   * It is deliberately, aggressively undressed. There is no reef, no seabed
   * sculpt, no fauna, no sky dome, no water shader, no steam, no performers, and
   * no per-leg palette. Every one of those existed here and was removed on
   * 2026-08-10, because the room had been dressed to a fourth-gate finish
   * without its second gate ever being checked — and it showed. Snow peaks were
   * four-sided cones 42 m wide, painted flat white and unlit, which read as
   * igloos. Reef specimens ran to 66 m. Backdrop planes floated with nothing
   * joining them to the ground.
   *
   * None of that was a rendering bug. It was art applied to a volume nobody had
   * ever stood inside and judged. So the volume gets judged first.
   *
   * ── The rules this file keeps ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * 1. EVERY visible box is a collider, and every collider is a visible box.
   *    What you see is exactly what you can stand on and walk into. The
   *    terrain program (water-traverse-terrain.ts) is the single source; a
   *    surface it does not know about cannot appear here.
   *
   * 2. Material carries ROLE, not mood. Floor, wall, ceiling, portal, mass —
   *    five values of grey, and that is the whole palette. Two accent colours
   *    exist and are not scenery: orange is a measuring instrument, blue is a
   *    place the visitor is meant to stop.
   *
   * 3. Light is constant. It does not change by leg, depth, or position. A
   *    graybox that relights itself as you walk cannot tell you whether a wall
   *    is too tall — it only tells you the lighting is pretty.
   *
   * Dressing comes back later, on top of a box that has been approved.

  The vents, in two parts: a mouth in the floor and a plume over it.

  The plume is narrow at the floor and wide at the top, which is the opposite of
  what this was: a 8 m base tapering to 5 m at the ceiling read as a pile of
  something, heaped on the floor. A plume entrains water as it rises, so it
  opens as it goes — and a shape that starts at a POINT on the floor and opens
  upward is the one that says the thing came out of a hole down there.

  The mouth is what makes that claim survive being looked at. Translucent white
  in a room whose every surface is mid-grey is a weak mark at any opacity that
  does not also stack into a wall; a hard warm disc lying IN the floor cannot be
  missed and cannot be mistaken for anything but an opening. Pitched to the
  grade it lies in, because this floor is climbing 18° and a flat disc on it
  buries one edge and floats the other.
