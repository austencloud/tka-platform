/**
 * Which bodies an inspection lab under `/test` can put on stage.
 *
 * A lab that studies anatomy needs more bodies than the deployable catalog
 * ships: the hand-staged intake rig, and the controlled proportion sweep whose
 * copies move exactly one body dimension each. Registering those is a side
 * effect on a shared catalog, so it has to happen once, at module load, before
 * any picker reads it — not inside a render component, where the roster would
 * depend on whether a canvas had mounted yet.
 *
 * `staff-grip` owned this first. It moved here whole when the reach lab needed
 * the same roster, so both labs offer the same bodies and a character id means
 * the same thing in either address bar.
 *
 * Names follow `.claude/rules/3d-character-terminology.md`: a CHARACTER is the
 * visible 3D body. The package's `Avatar*` vocabulary stays at its own boundary.
