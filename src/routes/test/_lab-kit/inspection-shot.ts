/**
 * Solving one inspection camera.
 *
 * An inspection lab frames a REGION — a grip zone, a reach envelope — rather
 * than a performer, so it cannot use
 * `$lib/shared/3d/camera/compute-framing-shot`, which bakes in a 1.2 m
 * per-performer horizontal extent and a 2 m minimum distance. The vocabulary
 * here is the one `test/film-director/_lib/camera-language.ts` uses: declare a
 * subject box, an azimuth and an elevation, and solve the distance.
 *
 * This is the shared arithmetic only. Which subjects exist and which views a
 * lab offers stay with that lab: `staff-grip/inspection-framing.ts` owns the
 * grip lab's four panes, `negative-space-reach/reach-framing.ts` owns the reach
 * lab's. Both solve through this function so the panes across the two labs
 * share one magnification law.
