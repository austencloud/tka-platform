/**
 * The tree species that stand on the Flow Fest site, as ez-tree parameter sets.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The forest used to be a handful of baked GLBs reused across every placement,
 * so a walk through the site read as the same four trees over and over. This
 * catalog replaces those assets with procedurally generated ones from
 * `@dgreenheck/ez-tree` (MIT). Each entry describes a real species that belongs
 * on an Ohio / Indiana border farm woodlot in mid-May, at full leaf-out, and
 * each is generated at several seeds so no two trees share a silhouette.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
 * ---------------------
 * It does not decide WHERE trees stand. Placement is derived from the LiDAR
 * canopy return and the registered orthophoto, and it stays in
 * `flow-fest-forest-ecology.ts`. This module only says what a placement RENDERS
 * once something has chosen a species for it. The per-instance species seam is
 * `FlowFestTreeSpeciesPlan` at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * CALIBRATION
 * -----------
 * `createForestRuntimeTreeInstances` scales every instance uniformly by
 * `renderedHeightMeters / sourceHeight`, so a generated tree's absolute size in
 * ez-tree units never reaches the screen. Only two ratios survive that scaling:
 *
 *   crownRadiusRatio = crownRadius(P95) / height   how wide the canopy reads
 *   trunkHeightRatio = clearBoleHeight  / height   how much bare trunk shows
 *
 * Those two numbers are therefore the entire apparent-scale contract with the
 * outgoing assets. Every form below carries the pair it must hit, measured off
 * the GLBs it replaces (see `scripts/geospatial/measure_flow_fest_trees.mjs`),
 * and `scripts/geospatial/build_flow_fest_eztree_species.ts` solves the ez-tree
 * parameters until the generated tree lands within tolerance.
 *
 * This module must stay free of `$lib` imports so the build script can load it
 * with `tsx` outside the SvelteKit graph.

/**
 * The species roster.
 *
 * The brief proposed sugar maple, American beech, oak, black walnut, hickory,
 * Eastern redcedar, and a scrubby understory volunteer. Checking that against
 * what the placement logic actually casts found one gap and one extra need:
 *
 *  - The DAMP set (ground below 8.5 m, the wet hollow) had no wet-site species
 *    in the proposed list. The outgoing data filled that set with willows.
 *    American sycamore and silver maple are the two species that actually
 *    dominate an Ohio-valley bottomland, so both are here.
 *  - `chooseTreeFamily` explicitly rolls a 1.2% standing snag, which the
 *    outgoing data served with a dedicated dead-tree asset (0% foliage
 *    triangles). A snag form is therefore required, not decorative.
 *
 * Boxelder is the scrubby understory volunteer: a weedy, multi-stemmed,
 * short-boled maple that colonises disturbed farm edges throughout the region.
 *
 * The brief asked for ONE such volunteer, and one is what the first roster
 * shipped. Casting the real site then measured why that is not enough: this
 * woodlot is mostly closed canopy, so the placement pass produces 240 trees in
 * the short height class and 216 of them stand under a closed neighborhood.
 * With a single suppressed species that is 31% of every tree on the site
 * wearing one silhouette — precisely the ground-level repetition this catalog
 * replaced the reused GLBs to remove. American hophornbeam is the second one,
 * and it is the correct second one rather than a convenient one: it is the
 * characteristic shade-tolerant sub-canopy tree of Ohio and Indiana
 * beech-maple and oak-hickory woods, it occupies the same 8-12 m height class,
 * and its single slender stem is the opposite silhouette to boxelder's
 * sprawling multi-stem thicket.
