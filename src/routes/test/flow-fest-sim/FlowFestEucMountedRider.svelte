   * own frame task has run and before the frame renders, the pelvis is placed
   * over the support line and each leg is solved onto its own pedal anchor.
   *
   * The stage ordering is the whole trick. `Avatar3D` animates in `mainStage`,
   * so a stage declared `after: mainStage, before: renderStage` is the last
   * writer of these bones every frame - including the first frame the model
   * exists, which is why mounting never shows a walk cycle.

    Position, facing, and spine pitch are all zero on purpose.

    Every one of them is attitude the vehicle hierarchy already applies: this
    group is a child of the rider-lean frame, which carries heading, terrain
    pitch and roll, suspension travel, and visual lean. Feeding any of it to
    the avatar again is the double-application the fidelity criteria forbid.

    `moveSpeed` is zero so the locomotion state machine can never leave IDLE.
    Locomotion stays enabled because the idle clip is what keeps the arms,
    head, and breathing alive; only the legs and pelvis are overwritten.
