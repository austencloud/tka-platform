/**
 * Sequences the Flow Fest performers actually spin.
 *
 * The fire circle used to run three hand-authored demo fixtures on repeat. It
 * now spins LOOPs from the production generator, gated by the shared effect
 * preview policy: at least eight counts, a multiple of eight, and a seamless
 * seam so the closing count runs straight into count one.
 *
 * Generation is asynchronous, so the scene boots on the fixtures and swaps to
 * generated LOOPs when they land. A fixture that never gets replaced is
 * reported as such rather than passing silently for the real thing.
