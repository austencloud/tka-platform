/**
 * The registered geometry of the Kinetic Fire site, in world metres.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * These shapes are ground truth Austen gave in the section-by-section labeling
 * interview, traced over the registered orthophoto. They were living in a unit
 * test, and the tree layout needs the same polygons, so they now have one
 * owner and both consumers read from it. The full record — including how each
 * frame was registered and what Austen said about each zone — is
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/flow-fest-sim/site-labels-interview.md`.
 *
 * WORLD FRAME
 * -----------
 * EPSG:26916 (NAD83 / UTM 16N), origin at easting 690142 / northing 4384552:
 * `worldX = easting - 690142`, `worldZ = 4384552 - northing`. Axes are
 * x = east, y = up, z = south, so NEGATIVE z is north. The orthophoto is
 * 2048x2048 at 0.5 m/px with its top-left at world (-512, -512).
 *
 * This module holds shapes and point tests only. It must stay free of `$lib`
 * imports so scripts and tests can load it outside the SvelteKit graph.

 * The fire field in Middle Earth, as Austen sized it: "a section probably

 * oval". Seven cells of the interview's Middle Earth grid area-match an

 *
 * Nothing grows here. Austen, asked directly how many trees stand in it:
 * "completely bare".
