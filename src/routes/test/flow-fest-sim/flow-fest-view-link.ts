/**
 * Shareable viewpoints for the Flow Fest sim.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The sim could only be addressed by a registered review camera — `?gate3=1`
 * plus one of five ids. That is enough to re-shoot a known frame and useless
 * for the thing Austen actually does, which is walk the site, notice something,
 * and want to hand that exact spot to someone else. Austen, 2026-09-03: "I'm
 * unable to send you a URL to give you the exact placement of where I'm looking
 * at it under this test page it always just hard codes the moment and the
 * camera but it doesn't actually show the location like the XYZ like we do in
 * other 3D scenes."
 *
 * "Like we do in other 3D scenes" is literal, and this file does not reinvent
 * it: `$lib/shared/3d/domain/camera-url-pose` already owns the `?cam=&look=&fov=`
 * vocabulary that the ocean, autumn, winter, celestial, and forest review routes
 * share. What is genuinely new here is the conversion, because this route has no
 * orbit camera to read a target off — it has a walking player with a yaw and a
 * pitch.
 *
 * ROUND TRIP
 * ----------
 * The walk scene turns a review camera into that pair through `yawPitchForCamera`:
 * `yaw = atan2(dx, dz)` and `pitch = atan2(positionY - targetY, horizontal)` —
 * note that a POSITIVE pitch is looking DOWN. The look point produced here is
 * the exact inverse, which is what lets a pasted link land on the frame it came
 * from instead of somewhere near it.
