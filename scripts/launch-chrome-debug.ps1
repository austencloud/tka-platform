  launch-chrome-debug.ps1

  Starts or reuses one shared, persistent Chrome with remote debugging on port
  9222. The chrome-devtools MCP server attaches to it (configured with
  --browserUrl=http://127.0.0.1:9222) instead of spawning an isolated
  automation instance.

  Why this exists:
    - The MCP-launched Chrome carries --enable-automation, which shows the
      "Chrome is being controlled by automated test software" banner AND makes
      Google / Firebase sign-in refuse credentials. Attaching to a Chrome we
      launch ourselves (WITHOUT that flag) is a normal browser — sign-in works,
      cookies persist, no banner.
    - This profile is dedicated + persistent: sign in once and stay signed in
      across sessions. It runs alongside your everyday Chrome (separate
      --user-data-dir), and current Chrome REQUIRES a non-default user-data-dir
      to expose the debug port anyway.
    - The visible window uses normal Windows display scaling. Exact test
      viewports belong to the MCP emulate tool, not Chrome launch flags.
    - Chrome restores the window size and position last saved in this profile.
      The launcher does not maximize, resize, or reposition the window.
    - A named mutex serializes concurrent launcher calls. Multiple agents attach
      to the same browser process and open task-owned tabs in its existing
      window instead of racing to start duplicate instances.

  Usage:
    pwsh scripts/launch-chrome-debug.ps1            # opens https://localhost:5173
    pwsh scripts/launch-chrome-debug.ps1 -Url https://tkaflowarts.com

  Then start or restart Codex or Claude Code. The chrome-devtools tools drive
  this window, logged in as you.
