# Unified dev server startup
# - Starts the Vite dev server (background), waits until it actually serves,
#   THEN starts the Cloudflare tunnel (dev.tkaflowarts.com).
# - Verifies installed dependency manifests and imports before Vite starts. A
#   broken install is rebuilt from the frozen lockfile and rechecked first.
# - Restores the machine-local mkcert certificate pair before Vite starts. The
#   tunnel always targets HTTPS, so allowing Vite to silently fall back to HTTP
#   would leave a connected tunnel returning 502s.
# - Ordering matters: cloudflared connects to Cloudflare's edge in ~1s, but Vite
#   on a project this size takes much longer to boot. If the tunnel comes up
#   first, dev.tkaflowarts.com returns 502 Bad Gateway for the whole cold-boot
#   window (edge connected, origin not yet answering). Gating the tunnel on a
#   real 200 from the origin closes that window.
# - The script supervises Vite and the public tunnel independently. If
#   cloudflared exits or stops serving while Vite is healthy, only the tunnel
#   is recycled with bounded backoff. A dead tunnel can no longer leave the
#   Agent Hub process looking healthy indefinitely.
#
# Tunnel credentials (one-time setup on a new machine), first match wins:
#   1. Token file:  %USERPROFILE%\.cloudflared\tka-dev.token
#      (paste the tunnel token from Cloudflare Zero Trust -> Networks -> Tunnels,
#       or run `cloudflared tunnel token tka-dev` on a logged-in machine)
#   2. Origin cert: %USERPROFILE%\.cloudflared\cert.pem  (from `cloudflared tunnel login`)
# If neither exists the tunnel is skipped with a warning and Vite starts anyway.
