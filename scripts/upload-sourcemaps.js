/**
 * Inject PostHog debug-ID metadata into the built JS, upload the matching
 * sourcemaps, then delete EVERY .map file in the output — so
 * `capture_exceptions` in production resolves real stack traces instead of
 * "chunks/Cu5DaGTC.js:16:30809" with "resolved": false, without a single
 * sourcemap ever leaving this machine except to PostHog.
 *
 * The sweep is the load-bearing part, and it is unconditional. `npm run build`
 * is not just the Cloudflare Pages deploy command — android-build.yml,
 * ios-build.yml and capgo-deploy.yml all run it too, none of them have PostHog
 * credentials, and capacitor.config.ts points webDir at this very directory.
 * So a .map file left behind here is not a stale local artifact: `cap sync`
 * copies it into the signed Android AAB and the iOS IPA, and Capgo pushes it
 * as an OTA bundle to already-installed devices. Relying on the PostHog CLI's
 * own --delete-after would leak in exactly the builds that never call it, and
 * would leak CSS sourcemaps even in the build that does — the CLI filters on
 * is_javascript_file (.js/.mjs/.cjs), and Vite emits a .css.map per CSS chunk,
 * of which this project has ~499. trim-deploy-assets.js doesn't touch .map
 * either; it only strips screenshots, thumbnails, and files over 25 MiB.
 *
 * Hence: upload when credentialed, and sweep on every path out of this script.
 *
 * A PostHog outage must never fail a TKA deploy. Symbolicated stack traces are
 * a diagnostic nicety; shipping the app is not. Upload failures log and exit 0.
