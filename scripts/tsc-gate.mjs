/**
 * Plain-`tsc` gate for the app's own TypeScript.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `svelte-check` is the project's headline type gate, but it does not stand in
 * for `tsc`: it type-checks through the Svelte language service and, when the
 * generated `.svelte-kit` tree is not exactly what it expects, it can report
 * "0 errors" over a program it never really assembled. A plain compiler pass
 * over the same `tsconfig.json` is cheap, has no such failure mode, and is the
 * thing that keeps `src/**` and `tests/**` honest between svelte-check runs.
 *
 * WHY IT FILTERS
 *
 * `tsconfig.json` uses `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` with the `svelte` export
 * condition, so some dependencies resolve to their raw `.ts` sources instead of
 * `.d.ts` files. `skipLibCheck` does not skip those, and this app's stricter
 * flags (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `strict`) then surface errors inside
 * `node_modules` and inside sibling workspace packages that those packages
 * never opted into and that this repo cannot fix from here. Workspace packages
 * have their own gate — `pnpm run build:packages` builds them under their own
 * tsconfig, and CI already runs it.
 *
 * So the gate reports every diagnostic and fails only on the ones this
 * tsconfig actually owns: files under `src/` and `tests/` in this checkout.
 * Anything else is printed as context, never as a build failure.
