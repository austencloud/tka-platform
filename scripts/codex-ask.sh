# Ask Codex (OpenAI CLI) a question about this repo, non-interactively.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/codex-ask.sh <prompt-file> [output-file]
#   echo "some prompt" | scripts/codex-ask.sh - [output-file]
#
# Prints the path to the answer file on success.
#
# Why the flags, since every one of them is load-bearing:
#
#   --ignore-user-config
#       ~/.codex/config.toml registers plugin marketplaces for the Codex
#       DESKTOP APP, one of them at a `/mnt/c/...` WSL path that cannot resolve
#       on Windows. The CLI hands those to its tool host at startup, the host
#       dies with "code-mode host exited during handshake", and the run ends
#       having read zero files. This flag skips that config; auth.json is still
#       read from CODEX_HOME, so it stays signed in. Do NOT "fix" this by
#       editing ~/.codex/config.toml -- that file belongs to the desktop app.
#
#   -o <file>
#       codex exec drops its final message on long runs: the work happens, the
#       report never arrives, exit code is 0. Four separate runs died this way.
#       This writes the last message to a file instead of relying on stdout.
#
#   -m
#       --ignore-user-config also discards the model setting, so it has to be
#       named here or the CLI falls back to its own default.
#
# Trust levels are also discarded by --ignore-user-config, which does not
# matter: --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox already bypasses approval.

#   </dev/null on the exec below
#       The prompt is already in $PROMPT by this point, so codex needs nothing
#       from stdin -- but if stdin is an open pipe it does not know that, and
#       parks on "Reading additional input from stdin..." forever. That is not
#       hypothetical: one run sat for three hours having burned 0.03s of CPU
#       and read zero files. Closing stdin makes the hang unrepresentable.
#
#   timeout
#       So a wedged or pathologically slow run fails loudly with a transcript
#       instead of looking identical to one that is still thinking.
