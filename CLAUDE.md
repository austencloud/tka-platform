# Flow Arts Composer: Claude Code Adapter

@AGENTS.md

The imported file is the shared contract for Codex, Claude Code, and other
coding agents.

## Priority

- The current user request defines the objective and authorized scope. It
  overrides repository rules and skills unless a higher-priority platform or
  safety instruction conflicts.
- Apply `.claude/rules/*.md` only when the task matches the rule's domain or
  affected paths. Do not treat a historical plan, dated rationale, memory link,
  model name, or quoted incident as current policy.
- When two project files conflict, follow `AGENTS.md`, then the most specific
  matching contract. Report a material unresolved conflict instead of inventing
  a compromise.

## Claude-Specific Operation

- Use the available Claude tool equivalent when shared guidance names a Codex
  tool. Tool names and model catalogs are runtime facts, not repository policy.
- Use the configured Chrome DevTools MCP and
  `scripts/launch-chrome-debug.ps1` for local application verification. Keep one
  task-owned tab, pass its page ID to scoped calls, emulate viewports per page,
  and close only that tab when finished.
- Use the dedicated agent browser profile for application testing. Austen
  completes password, passkey, CAPTCHA, and consent interactions. Do not use his
  personal browser session without explicit authorization.
- Never start, restart, replace, or kill the dev server on port 5173. Use the
  IPv6 HTTPS probe and a task-owned free port when a separate server is needed.
- In a Git repository, follow the worktree and scoped-commit lifecycle in
  `AGENTS.md`. Preserve unrelated work and never use destructive Git cleanup.

Do not add model-version guidance, tool inventories, incident histories, or
duplicated project rules here. Put durable architecture in `docs/architecture/`
and keep this adapter small.
