## Source of Truth

**`story-bible.md` is the canonical document.** Everything else is supplementary. If anything conflicts with the story bible, the story bible wins.

The museum-dev tracker (`node scripts/museum-dev.js`) records how decisions were made. The story bible records where the lore stands now.

## Key Decisions (Locked)

From the story bible's Canonical Decisions table:

| Decision | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Engine | Unreal Engine 5 |
| Tone | Museum of Jurassic Technology meets Stanley Parable. Commit to the bit, never wink. |
| K | One character: narrator + annotator + defector + developer + renovator. Never seen, traces only. Male, born ~1968. |
| Endings | Three sequential rooms (Fear / Isolation / Collaboration), not branching choices. Scrooge effect. |
| Austen | Meta-only. Not a character. No exhibit, no named mention. Developer and voice actor. |
| Factions | Order of the Closed Palm (Bureau of Kinetic Containment) vs. The Scribes. |
| Vessels | Concept retired. Historical figures are Scribes, not reincarnating souls. |
| Lethe | Ancient, repeated across history, always incomplete. Not a single 1994 event. |
| Building | "The Kinetic Archive" on entrance. Three architectural eras: Order-built (pre-2003), Crumble (2003-2008), K's museum (post-2008). |
| VTG handling | Terms as Easter eggs. System name "Vulcan Tech Gospel" never appears in fiction. |
| Andy Kaufman Rule | The audience's confusion about what's real IS the art. |

## Open Questions

See story bible for the full list. Major unresolved:

- K's current status (alive when player enters? Born ~1968, would be ~58 in 2026)
- Infrastructure during the gap (who kept the lights on?)
- The Space Age (missing aesthetic chapter: 1950s-1980s)
- Flow state as disease (Order's specific pathological model)
- Re-emergence theories (each deserves its own exhibit)
- Interactive exhibits (biggest addressable risk per story audit)
