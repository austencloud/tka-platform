# Guide 4K Per-Page Polish Plan

**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Context:** The lockstep scaling system shipped (spec
`2026-07-19-guide-4k-lockstep-design.md`, commit ff1d5ad8a5). A full 39-page
audit at emulated 3840x2160 followed. Austen's directive: every page gets a
careful eye, one by one; pages that are lovely get left alone.
**Verification budget note:** machine RAM is tight. Executors make file edits
only - NO vite servers, NO svelte-check, NO builds (per
feedback_no_heavy_checks_in_subagents). Browser verification happens batched at
the end from the main session via the already-running chrome-devtools MCP.

## Shared fixes (each unlocks multiple pages)

### A. Sheet upscale — the codex fix [AGENT-1]
`src/routes/(public)/guide/level-1/_components/GuidePageHost.svelte:79`
caps fit-to-width at `Math.min(1, wrap/816)`. At 4K the 816px print sheet
floats tiny in the dark canvas (codex, codex-2, and the sheet toggle on every
topic page).
- Remove the 1 cap; clamp to `Math.min(wrap.clientWidth / 816, 1.9)`.
- Reserve the scaled footprint: bind the sheet-wrap (or a spacer) height to
  `1056 * scale` px so upscaling does not overlap the topic-nav below
  (transform does not affect layout; today the reserved box is the unscaled
  1056px).
- `/guide/codex/+page.svelte` stacks CodexSheet artboards the same way -
  apply the same scale-to-fit treatment there (it currently has no scaling at
  all; sheets render at fixed size, centered).

### B. pic-card letterbox fix [AGENT-1]
`src/routes/(public)/guide/level-1/_components/FlowFrame.svelte` `.pic-card`
renders wider than its square pictograph in flow-grids, leaving gray side
bands inside cards (visible: hm-type56 statics, lt2-wxyz, lt3-dash-letters,
lt456 pair cards). Give the card `aspect-ratio: 1` (or size it to the square
content) so the frame hugs the pictograph.

### C. flow width caps ride the ramp [AGENT-1]
In FlowFrame.svelte, at `@media (min-width: 1680px)`:
- `.flow-grid` max-width 30rem -> 40rem (4-cell grids currently 720px in a
  1488px frame)
- `.flow-grid-figure` max-width 18rem -> 24rem (the-grid's diamond/box/8pt
  squares)
- `.flow-figure` max-width 15rem -> 20rem
Keep base (sub-1680) values untouched.

### D. Pictograph hydration speed [INVESTIGATE - separate session]
permutations + reversals sit with empty cells ~4-6s before SVGs paint
(verified: 18/18 painted after 6s wait). Likely the motion-data/dataframe
import chain. Investigate lazy-chunk preloading on route entry. Layout is
fine; this is the thing a visitor would call broken.

### E. Definition litany grid [NEEDS AUSTEN'S EYE]
hand-motions renders six one-line term definitions (Dual-Shift, Shift,
Cross-Shift, Dash, Dual-Dash, Static) as a tall single column with heavy air.
Proposal: a definition-grid block (2-3 columns at >=1680px) in the
guide-content block pipeline. Touches content structure
(`_data/guide-content.ts` + FlowFrame block kinds) - do not build without
visual sign-off on a mock first.

## Per-page verdicts (39 pages)

Legend: LOVELY = leave alone. Letters reference shared fixes above.

| # | Page | Verdict / work |

| 37 | level-2/turns | LOVELY at 4K. Separate known issue: ~32px mobile overflow from showcase-wrap at 390px (pre-existing, phone-scope) |
| 38 | level-2/double-turns | sibling of 37 |
| 39 | /guide/codex (standalone) | A. (codex/parity + codex/poster are dev tools - out of scope) |

## Execution order

1. [ ] AGENT-1: fixes A + B + C (pure file edits, scoped commit)
2. [ ] Batched browser verification at 3840 + 1366 regression: codex,
       hm-type56, lt2-wxyz, the-grid, hand-positions, one sheet-toggle topic
       page. Sibling pages (29-35) spot-check ONE of them.
3. [ ] D investigation (fresh session)
4. [ ] E + optionals (2, 19) after Austen's visual sign-off
5. [ ] Mobile overflow on 37 (separate phone-scope pass)

## Verification checklist for step 2

- Codex sheet fills ~70-90% of the content track at 3840, no overlap with
  the nav below, crisp at 1.9x
- No gray bands inside pic-cards on hm-type56 / lt2-wxyz
- the-grid squares ~576px at 3840; still 288px at 1366 (unchanged below 1680)
- 1366 renders byte-identical to pre-change on a LOVELY page (words)
