# Spec Index

Every design spec, handoff, audit and review sitting loose in this folder, with an evidence-backed status. **Archive-only policy: nothing here has been deleted or moved.** Status is a reading of the repository, not a verdict on the idea — a SUPERSEDED doc is still worth keeping, and a SHIPPED doc often has open follow-ups named in its Next action column.

**202 loose specs in `docs/superpowers/specs/`** (files already filed under `active/`, `backlog/`, `shipped/`, `archived/` and the named subfolders are not listed here).

| Status | Count | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SHIPPED | 139 | The thing it describes exists in `src/` or landed in a named commit. |
| SUPERSEDED | 13 | A later doc replaced it, or the doc says so itself. |
| IN-FLIGHT | 23 | Partly built — an open ledger, an open branch, or a named blocker. |
| OPEN | 27 | Still an idea. Nothing built, nothing supersedes it. |

Nothing has been deleted or moved. This index is the only new file.

## Open ideas worth a look

Complete enough to hand to an executor, and nothing supersedes them.

| # | File | Why it is worth a look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [`2026-08-02-notation-caps-4k-density-correction.md`](./2026-08-02-notation-caps-4k-density-correction.md) | 743-line PROPOSED spec, executor-ready, no successor. Just needs a yes or a no. |
| 2 | [`2026-08-05-sequence-combinator-redesign-design.md`](./2026-08-05-sequence-combinator-redesign-design.md) | Supersedes the shipped-then-rejected 08-04 lab. Three combinator docs below are blocked on this review. |
| 3 | [`2026-08-05-loop-detection-false-negatives-handoff.md`](./2026-08-05-loop-detection-false-negatives-handoff.md) | A real bug with a written repro: `detect_loop_pattern` is nondeterministic and misses loops. |
| 4 | [`2026-08-05-ghost-presence-design.md`](./2026-08-05-ghost-presence-design.md) | Austen approved it "full send" on 08-05 and nothing was built. Always-on breathing presence. |
| 5 | [`2026-08-10-scene-composer-all-scenes-handoff.md`](./2026-08-10-scene-composer-all-scenes-handoff.md) | Select/place/move/save exists for one scene; the handoff is the rollout to every Scene Lab scene. |
| 6 | [`2026-08-06-effects-3d-instancing-handoff.md`](./2026-08-06-effects-3d-instancing-handoff.md) | One unchecked item — the real-viewer parity sweep — stands between this and closed. |
| 7 | [`2026-08-05-vulcan-cave-ornament-grammar.md`](./2026-08-05-vulcan-cave-ornament-grammar.md) | The grammar is derived and written. Applying it per room is mechanical work with a spec to follow. |
| 8 | [`2026-08-28-stage-footfall-planning-handoff.md`](./2026-08-28-stage-footfall-planning-handoff.md) | Walk Lab footfall plans exist; wiring the Stage timeline to them is the last hop. |
| 9 | [`2026-08-28-gait-timing-plan-experiment.md`](./2026-08-28-gait-timing-plan-experiment.md) | A single named experiment with a stated hypothesis. Cheap to run, unblocks the gait thread. |
| 10 | [`2026-08-23-glossary-codex-recovery-handoff.md`](./2026-08-23-glossary-codex-recovery-handoff.md) | `/glossary` is an empty `+page.ts` on disk. The handoff says exactly what to rebuild. |
| 11 | [`2026-09-01-v0-40-release-writing-handoff.md`](./2026-09-01-v0-40-release-writing-handoff.md) | The release exists; only the user-facing notes are missing. Bounded writing task. |
| 12 | [`2026-08-27-tunnel-editing-handoff.md`](./2026-08-27-tunnel-editing-handoff.md) | Self-describes as nothing-pushed with the design settled — a clean pickup. |
| 13 | [`2026-09-01-composer-showcase-range-design.md`](./2026-09-01-composer-showcase-range-design.md) | Small, well-scoped: widen the Composer showcase past four beats. |
| 14 | [`2026-08-21-versioned-visual-artifact-publication-design.md`](./2026-08-21-versioned-visual-artifact-publication-design.md) | Publish tunnels, mandalas and scenes without exposing private saves. Design is complete. |
| 15 | [`2026-08-17-ocean-performer-command-bar-opus-test-handoff.md`](./2026-08-17-ocean-performer-command-bar-opus-test-handoff.md) | An acceptance pass, not a build. One cold run on `/test/ocean-scene` closes it. |
