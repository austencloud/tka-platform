# Unified Learn and Atlas - Handoff (2026-08-28)

## Mission

Unify Interactive Lessons, Play, the written Guide, the Kinetic Atlas, the
Letter Codex, TIKA, and Composer handoffs around one concept graph. The Atlas is
the bird's-eye map of the same journey the lessons teach. The governing design
is [`active/2026-08-28-unified-learn-atlas-design.md`](active/2026-08-28-unified-learn-atlas-design.md).

## Done - verified

- The governing design is committed in `b2cb81c741`. It defines the Atlas as
  the bird's-eye map, lessons as the guided journey, one concept-place contract,
  official TKA level vocabulary, and human confirmation gates.
- Game-local progression was renamed from levels to challenges in
  `6edf5e581c`. Current games are explicitly `unclassified` against TKA levels;
  legacy local and Firestore progress still migrates without data loss.
- The first official Level 1 concept map was implemented in `69c34007ec`.
  Stable `?place=1.x` routes select official knowledge-graph nodes and compose
  the real lesson, Guide, Letter Atlas, and Composer owners where evidence
  exists. Unmapped and partial places say so instead of inventing coverage.
- The public Atlas landing now renders that same official Level 1 concept map.
  The arbitrary six-region glossary board and its hand-written decorative SVGs
  were removed. Search temporarily yields the canvas to matching terms, then
  restores the selected concept place when cleared. Live verification covered
  the required compact, tablet, desktop, 4K, and 200% layouts with no page-width
  overflow. Selection, reload, Back/Forward, the Letter Atlas handoff, and the
  `type1-abc-ghi` lesson handoff all preserve the canonical `?place=1.5` state.
- Focused verification is green: six test files, 49 tests, plus
  `svelte-check` with 0 errors and 0 warnings. Source-copy tests also guard
  against reintroducing game-local Level labels.
- The three implementation commits were merged into `main` as `38bdf03b22`
  without changing Austen's existing `pnpm-lock.yaml` edit.
- The broken primary dependency install was repaired from the existing frozen
  lock without changing its hash: `@ai-sdk/svelte@4.0.70` and `zod@4.3.6` now
  resolve correctly from a fresh Node process.
- The first live Atlas correction is committed in `7c8d41a42f`. The Level 1
  concepts now read as one connected route, including the truthful 1.5/1.6
  prerequisite branch, instead of eight generic cards. The selected 1.1 place
  uses the real shared Diamond and Box grid renderer. Compact layouts use a
  scrollable stop rail; the public landing uses normal page flow instead of a
  viewport-height inner scroller.
- The Atlas-to-lesson return contract is verified in `7c8d41a42f`: selecting
  1.5 produced `?place=1.5`, opening its lesson produced
  `/learn/concepts/type1-abc-ghi?place=1.5`, and Back plus reload both returned
  to the Atlas with 1.5 selected. Type 1, Motions, and Positions now return to
  the Atlas when their internal lesson navigation is already at the first step.
- Follow-up verification for `7c8d41a42f` is green: `svelte-check` reported 0
  errors and 0 warnings; the focused concept-place suite passed 6/6; live
  in-app browser checks covered 375x667, 960x412, 820x1180, 1440x900,
  1920x1080, 2560x1440, and 3840x2160 with no page-width overflow and no
  console errors. The only console messages were the expected local PostHog
  no-key warnings.
- Level 1.4 Rotation Direction is implemented in `8e946a002f`. It uses the
  canonical A/B pair to compare pro and anti on the same hand paths, lets the
  learner switch relationships immediately, checks both directions, and keeps
  base rotation distinct from additional turns. Wide canvases reveal both real
  pictographs together; narrower layouts preserve the focused selector-first
  flow.
- The explicit Atlas route now outranks saved lesson progress. A direct
  `/learn/concepts?place=1.4` link stays on the Atlas with 1.4 selected instead
  of being hijacked by an old persisted lesson. The route was also opened in a
  fresh tab with existing saved progress and resolved to the same place.
- Verification for `8e946a002f` is green after rebasing onto the current
  `main`: four focused files passed 23/23 tests, and `svelte-check` reported 0
  errors and 0 warnings. Live checks covered 375x667, 960x412, 820x1180,
  1440x900, 1920x1080, 2560x1440, and 3840x2160. There was no horizontal
  overflow, the root remained 16px at compact and 4K widths, and the console
  reported no errors.
- The landing hierarchy and responsive composition were corrected in
  `8cd3cfa4b1`. The course introduction and current lesson now form one launch
  zone, Continue is the only saturated primary action, and the Guide plus
  selected Atlas resources remain available without competing for the first
  click. The current lesson category no longer collapses into a thin sliver.
- The Atlas detail layout in `8cd3cfa4b1` uses the real shared Diamond and Box
  grids at a readable bounded size, compact resource actions, a rail wide enough
  to preserve every concept name, and a compact reference card for places such
  as 1.4 that do not have an honest visual preview. It no longer stretches
  controls or empty detail surfaces across the available width.
- Level 1.6 Orientations is connected in `c211be2814` as a reference-only place.
  It links to the existing Staff Positions Guide section with explicit partial
  coverage, while leaving lessons, practice, exploration, and Composer handoffs
  empty until those capabilities have truthful focused owners. The legacy Staff
  lesson is not presented as the 1.6 lesson because it also teaches prospin,
  antispin, and a quiz.
- Focused verification for `c211be2814` passed 13/13 registry and experience
  tests. Live `?place=1.6` checks covered 375x667, 960x412, 820x1180,
  1440x900, 1920x1080, 2560x1440, and 3840x2160. Every viewport kept a 16px
  root and zero page-width overflow; the route exposed the partial Guide action
  without stretched or clipped controls, and the console reported no errors.
- Verification for `8cd3cfa4b1` is green after rebasing onto the then-current
  `main`: `svelte-check` reported 0 errors and 0 warnings, and the focused
  concept-place suites passed 11/11 tests. Live checks covered 375x667,
  960x412, 820x1180, 1440x900, 1920x1080, 2560x1440, and 3840x2160. The 1.4
  deep link retained its selection, all checked widths had zero page overflow,
  the root stayed 16px, and the console reported no errors. The broader landing
  morph suite still has its pre-existing `/glossary` participant failure on
  both the task branch and the baseline `main` checkout.
- The standalone Grid Guide topic was recomposed as a compact overview in
  `d4ce6a0b4b`, `0b30889e9e`, `e01a38f084`, and `0894d8d9a2`. The topic no
  longer asks readers to choose Page versus Reflow: it uses the semantic reflow
  content directly, keeps the print/book sheet as the separate print owner, and
  places the contextual Grid lesson link in the title row instead of a dedicated
  vertical band. The authored explanation now pairs its opening and point
  definitions with the real hand pictograph, then compares Diamond, Box, and the
  combined 8-point grid in one row on wide layouts. At 1440x900 the teaching
  content ends at 826px instead of producing the previous 2967px document.
  Focused Guide contracts passed 14/14, both changed Svelte components compiled
  with 0 warnings, the root stayed 16px through 3840x2160, and every checked
  viewport had zero page-width overflow.

## Believed done - unverified

- The revised route, 1.4 lesson, and landing hierarchy have objective responsive
  and interaction proof, but Austen has not yet completed the required human
  confidence pass on the latest layout. Do not mark any lesson `CONFIRMED` from
  the automated checks.

## In flight

- No implementation is in flight. The verified 1.6 reference-only connection
  `c211be2814` was fast-forwarded into `main` on 2026-08-30.
- The task-owned 5188 preview was stopped and its Chrome DevTools tab was
  closed after the final rebase check.

## Loose ends (ranked)

1. Have Austen physically test the landing route and the existing 1.1, 1.2,
   1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 lessons before changing any status to `CONFIRMED`.
2. Connect 1.7 and 1.8 one at a time through the same registry and route
   contract. Each needs a real lesson/reference owner or an honest map-only
   state. Keep 1.6 reference-only until a focused orientation lesson is built
   and approved.
3. Add higher-level Atlas navigation only when the official knowledge graph and
   available resources can support a useful destination without pretending the
   material is taught.
4. Classify games against official TKA levels only after the concept and level
   evidence exists; keep unknown games `unclassified`.
5. Extend the same concept-place contract beyond the first Level 1 slice rather
   than creating another navigation system.

## Decisions already made

- On 2026-08-28, Austen approved unifying Learn, games, Atlas, Guide, Codex, and
  related tools into one interwoven product.
- On 2026-08-28, Austen required that "Level 2" mean TKA Level 2. Game-local
  progression must use distinct language so it cannot be confused with TKA
  curriculum levels.
- On 2026-08-28, Austen approved reliable human approval gates and requested a
  durable handoff so deep lesson polish cannot erase the bird's-eye goal.
- The Atlas is a map and review layer, not a prose glossary or a second lesson
  path.
- The Guide owns the linear journey and authored reference; concept places link
  to it contextually.
- Games are concept practice. Their global arcade can remain as an alternate
  entry point, but it is not a separate curriculum.
- Real artifacts and existing capability owners replace invented decorative
  diagrams.

## Gotchas

- `src/lib/features/learn/domain/concepts.ts` and
  `packages/domain/src/curriculum/knowledge-graph.ts` define different ID
  vocabularies. Do not merge them by string inference.
- `ConceptProgressTracker` and `PlayProgressStore` persist different progress
  shapes. Do not call either one unified mastery without a tested projection.
- Historical persisted game fields such as `levelNumber`, `starsByLevel`, and
  `levelsUnlocked` are migration inputs only. New UI and state use challenge
  vocabulary.
- The public Atlas landing uses the official Level 1 concept graph. Glossary
  categories remain search and reference metadata, not curriculum structure.
- Only seven lesson experiences are registered today. `docs/learn/concept-status.md`
  is the status authority, and `CONFIRMED` requires human interaction.
- The public Learn route pulls a large client graph on a cold Vite start. The
  task-owned preview required one dependency-optimization reload before the
  interactive course replaced its prerendered fallback. Do not mistake that
  local cold-start cost for a missing Atlas render without checking the server
  and browser logs.
