# Canonical Arrow Placement System

## Outcome

Arrow placement has one authored coordinate frame. Diamond and box remain display grids, but neither name owns placement data. A box pictograph resolves the same canonical adjustment as its diamond presentation and rotates the resulting screen-space vector 45 degrees clockwise around the pictograph center.

The canonical owner covers full-arrow position adjustments, arrow-glyph rotation flags, prop geometry, defaults, special placements, global overrides, and editor writes. Skewed motion remains a separate placement frame because it is not a rigid rotation of the canonical frame.

## Geometry contract

Let `C` be the pictograph center, `Pᴅ` a diamond anchor, and `Δᴅ` the final diamond adjustment after the directional-tuple transform.

```text
Pʙ = C + R45(Pᴅ - C)
Δʙ = R45(Δᴅ)
Aʙ = Pʙ + Δʙ = C + R45(Aᴅ - C)
```

The grid coordinator already supplies `Pʙ`, so the placement pipeline only applies `Δʙ = R45(Δᴅ)`.

Stored JSON and Firestore values are reference-frame values, not screen vectors. They must be processed with the diamond directional-tuple rules first. Rotating a raw stored tuple would be incorrect for motion types whose tuple transform depends on quadrant, direction, or orientation.

## Canonicalization boundary

For a box pictograph, the placement lookup context is normalized before any placement or rotation-override tier runs:

- `gridMode` becomes `diamond` on the pictograph and both motions.
- `startLocation`, `endLocation`, and `arrowLocation` rotate one 45-degree step counter-clockwise.
- letter, motion type, rotation direction, turns, orientations, prop types, and position group stay unchanged.
- the requested arrow location rotates one step counter-clockwise.

The complete placement cascade then runs in that canonical context:

1. global override
2. special placement
3. prop geometry
4. default placement
5. canonical directional-tuple transform
6. one 45-degree clockwise vector rotation when the displayed grid is box
7. manual per-pictograph adjustment in screen space

Diamond and non-rotational grid modes keep their existing behavior. Half-motion arrows keep their existing glyph-local path.

## Authoring and persistence

All placement editor identities and writes use the canonical context. A box arrow edit therefore addresses the same grid-neutral document and field as its diamond presentation.

WASD remains screen-relative:

1. rotate the requested box screen delta 45 degrees counter-clockwise;
2. invert the canonical directional-tuple transform;
3. save the resulting canonical reference-space delta.

Direct numeric inputs display and edit canonical reference values. Diagnostics name the canonical placement frame and grid-neutral static file.

Manual adjustment fields remain screen-space and pictograph-local. They are not rotated because they are applied after the calculated placement.

## Grid-neutral ownership

Display grid is forbidden in canonical placement storage:

- static assets live under `arrow_placement/default` and `arrow_placement/special`;
- canonical default filenames use `default_{motionType}_placements.json`;
- Firestore document IDs and override keys begin with the authored placement frame (`canonical` or `skewed`), never a display grid;
- schemas and repositories reject `diamond` and `box` as placement owners;
- rotation-override lookup canonicalizes the pictograph before it reads static or local data;
- regression tests and Firestore write rules reject display-grid asset paths, document IDs, and ownership fields.

Skewed data, when present, uses an explicit `skewed` placement-frame identity. It must not be folded into canonical storage until an independent transform and parity proof exist.

## Proof and regression coverage

Automated tests must prove:

- all eight perimeter locations round-trip between box and the canonical frame;
- vector magnitude is preserved by the 45-degree transform;
- a full box adjustment equals a rigidly rotated canonical adjustment for default and special-tier cases;
- diamond presentation output is unchanged;
- skewed and half-motion paths are unchanged;
- canonical special, global, default, and prop-geometry identities contain no display-grid segment;
- inverse WASD editing moves the rendered box arrow in the requested screen direction.
- static and dash glyph angles preserve the expected 45-degree presentation relationship;
- mirroring is identical for canonical-equivalent diamond and box contexts;
- rotation-override reads never request a diamond- or box-owned asset path;
- a canonical authoring write is read back by the production renderer under both display grids.

The visual proof surface ranks real legacy box-versus-canonical displacement and shows the worst cases side by side with the actual pictograph renderer. Each case includes the legacy position, the canonical rotated position, and the measured pixel correction.

## Retired surface

The diamond and box asset namespaces, grid-prefixed canonical document IDs, grid-prefixed override keys, duplicate box tuple branches, and parallel hardcoded adjustment processor are retired after migration proof passes. Display-grid code remains at the renderer boundary because it still owns anchors, prop presentation, and the final 45-degree transform.
