# Shop Cart + Order-Doc Persistence — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-13
**Status:** Active but blocked. Source implementation is in main; the local remediation is
verified but not committed or deployed.
**Related:** `project_shop_preview_phase` (approve/reject preview rides this spine), `project_loop_deck_shop_live` (live Stripe preorders), `project_physical_merch_store`

## Reconciliation, 2026-07-27

**Queue placement:** `active/`, classified under the queue's blocked bucket by
`depends_on`. Production does not yet satisfy the rollout described below.

The implementation landed in four July 13 and 14 commits, but the active spec still said
“ready for plan.” Production and source now disagree in the opposite direction:

- `single-buy-checkout-creator.ts` and `cart-checkout-creator.ts` send every purchase to
  `createCartCheckout`;
- `firebase functions:list` does not contain `createCartCheckout`;
- the deployed `createMerchCheckout` and `handleMerchWebhook` remain active;
- the remote Firestore field configuration has no TTL override for `orders.expiresAt`;
- the merch suite originally had only pure builder and mapper tests, with no callable write
  or webhook state-transition test.

The local correction made during reconciliation keeps the cart cutover from changing price
or shipping behavior when it is deployed:

- cart checkout now uses the existing server cutoff resolver for both the Stripe price ID
  and pending-order subtotal;
- carts containing a deck or sampler receive the free US shipping already included in the
  live product price;
- carts without one keep the $5 US rate;
- all US, Canada, and international rates carry Stripe shipping tax code
  `txcd_92010001`.

Focused verification of the uncommitted local remediation: 7 merch suites passed,
44 tests total, `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` exited 0 in
`firebase-functions`, and root `npm run check` finished with 0 errors and 4
warnings in files outside this change.

## Problem

The shop is live with single-product Stripe preorders. The current checkout path
crams the product + LOOP configuration into Stripe session **metadata**
(`firebase-functions/src/merch/checkoutParams.ts`), which caps at 500 chars per
value, and the webhook (`handleMerchWebhook.ts`) reconstructs the `orders/{id}`
doc **from that metadata after payment**. Two things this can't do:

1. **Multi-item orders** — a buyer wants a guide + poster + mug + LOOP deck in one
   purchase. Metadata can't hold N line items with per-item config.
2. **A configured deck's chosen sequences** — the future approve/reject preview
   phase (`project_shop_preview_phase`) must persist ~54 chosen sequences, which
   the metadata cap can't hold.

Both need the same thing: **the order doc must exist BEFORE payment**, holding the
full order, with Stripe carrying only a reference to it.

## Non-goals (out of scope; later specs)

- **Approve/reject preview phase** — writes `sequenceIds` into the pending order
  doc before checkout. This spec reserves the field; it does not build the phase.
- **Global-nav cart badge** — deliberately excluded. Cart chrome lives only inside
  `/shop`. A cart on the app-wide landing over-commercializes the tool.
- **Poster size variants** — one size ships first.
- **Buyer-configured posters** — posters are a fixed catalog for now.
- **Server-side persistent cart** — cart stays client-side (`localStorage`) until
  checkout. No Firestore write per add-to-cart.

## Architecture: server-authoritative draft order

One new spine. The client **never writes `orders` directly**. A new callable
resolves prices server-side against `products/{id}`, writes a `pending` order doc,
and builds the Stripe session referencing it. This kills the metadata cap and the
client-trusts-price hole in one move.

### Flow

1. Cart lives in `localStorage` (guest + signed-in alike — zero Firestore writes).
2. Checkout → callable **`createCartCheckout({ items })`** where
   `items: Array<{ productId: string; qty: number; propType?: string; loopConfig?: LoopConfigRequest }>`.
3. Server:
   - For each item, load `products/{productId}`; assert `status === "active"`;
     read the authoritative `stripePriceId` + `price` from the doc.
   - Validate any `loopConfig` with the existing `validateLoopConfig` /
     `validateRecipe` (from `checkoutParams.ts` — factor them out so the callable
     and the legacy path share one copy).
   - Write `orders/{id}` with `status: "pending"`, the resolved `lineItems`,
     `subtotal`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt = now + 24h`.
   - Build a Stripe Checkout session with N `line_items`
     (`{ price: stripePriceId, quantity }` each), `metadata.orderRef = id`, and the
     unchanged `automatic_tax` / `shipping_address_collection` /
     `shipping_options` / `payment_method_types: ["card"]`.
   - Persist `stripeSessionId` onto the doc. Return `{ url }`.
4. Webhook `checkout.session.completed`:
   - If `metadata.orderRef` present → load `orders/{orderRef}`, set `status:"paid"`,
     attach `stripePaymentIntentId`, `customerEmail`, `shippingAddress`,
     `totalAmount`, `paidAt`.
   - Else → the **existing** metadata-reconstruction path, kept for any in-flight
     legacy sessions. Removed after cutover.

Single-buy surfaces (listing "Preorder now", `LoopDeckConfiguratorPage`,
`DeckArchitectPage`) migrate to `createCartCheckout` with a **one-item** array, so
every purchase rides the spine and the forward webhook path is single. The
existing `createMerchCheckout` callable stays until cutover is verified in
production, then retires.

## Data model

### `orders/{id}` (server-written only)

```ts
{
  status: "pending" | "paid" | "expired";
  lineItems: Array<
    | { kind: "sku"; productId: string; stripePriceId: string; name: string;
        unitPrice: number; qty: number }                     // poster / mug / guide / prebuilt deck
    | { kind: "loopDeck"; productId: string; stripePriceId: string; name: string;
        unitPrice: number; qty: 1;
        propType?: string;
        loopConfig: { pack?: string; recipe?: RecipeSlice[]; level?: string;
                      length?: string; flavor?: string; custom?: Record<string, unknown> };
        sequenceIds?: string[] }                             // reserved for approve/reject phase
  >;
  subtotal: number;                 // sum(unitPrice * qty), pre-shipping/tax
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  expiresAt: Timestamp;             // +24h; Firestore TTL policy sweeps abandoned pending docs
  stripeSessionId?: string;         // set at checkout
  // webhook fills on paid:
  stripePaymentIntentId?: string;
  customerEmail?: string;
  shippingAddress?: { name; line1; line2; city; state; postalCode; country } | null;
  totalAmount?: number;             // grand total incl. shipping + tax
  paidAt?: Timestamp;
}
```

Legacy orders (no `orderRef`, `items` array from metadata) remain valid — the
success page and any admin tooling must read both shapes during the overlap.

### Cart state — `src/lib/features/store/state/shop-cart.svelte.ts`

`localStorage`-backed `$state` array. Line shape = the client-side subset of a
`lineItem` (no server fields). API:

- `add(item)`, `remove(key)`, `setQty(key, n)`, `clear()`
- derived `count`, derived `subtotal`
- SKU items: `qty >= 1`; dedupe by `productId` (adding again bumps qty).
- `loopDeck` items: `qty` locked to `1` (each configured deck is unique); **never**
  deduped (distinct configs are distinct lines).
- Persist round-trips through `localStorage` under one key (e.g. `tka:shop:cart`).

## Posters

Fixed catalog. Each poster = a Stripe product + price authored in the dashboard,
mirrored to `products/{id}` by the existing `product.*` / `price.*` webhook sync.
One size (13×19 print area on 19×13 Mohawk Everyday Digital 100lb cover stock;
self-fulfilled). Shop grid and `ProductDetailPage` list posters with no change
beyond an **Add to cart** action. No draft-config path — a poster is a plain SKU
line. Fulfillment: paid order doc → printed by the operator.

## Components (all under `/shop`; none global)

- **`shop-cart.svelte.ts`** — state module above.
- **`CartDrawer.svelte`** — wraps existing `src/lib/shared/foundation/ui/Drawer.svelte`
  + `DrawerHeader.svelte`. Line list, qty steppers (button `+`/`−`, **no checkbox**
  per `no-checkboxes.md`), per-line remove, subtotal, Checkout button, empty state.
- **`CartButton.svelte`** — cart affordance + count badge, rendered **only** in
  `src/routes/(public)/shop/+layout.svelte` header. Not in app-wide navigation.
- **`AddToCartButton`** — extend existing `BuyButton.svelte` with a
  `mode: "buy" | "add"` prop rather than forking a parallel component
  (`never-hand-roll.md`). Buttons per `clickables-look-like-buttons.md`, 44px floor.
- Configurator / Architect: add a secondary **Add to cart**; keep primary
  **Preorder now** as a direct one-item checkout (the listing stays a conversion
  page — `project_shop_preview_phase` framing).

## Error handling

- Product inactive at checkout → callable throws `failed-precondition`; client
  toasts and flags the offending line in the cart.
- Price drift → server always uses the current `products/{id}` price. If it differs
  from the cart's last-known `unitPrice`, the cart shows a "price updated" note
  before checkout so the total is never a surprise.
- Stripe session failure → `internal` error → toast.
- Empty cart → Checkout disabled.
- Abandoned `pending` docs → `expiresAt` TTL policy on the `orders` collection.

## Security

- `orders`: **no client write** (Firestore rule denies client writes; only the
  callable's admin SDK writes). Read is gated — the success page resolves an order
  by Stripe session via a callable, not an open collection read.
- Client-supplied prices are never trusted; `stripePriceId` + `unitPrice` are read
  server-side from `products/{id}`.
- `loopConfig` re-validated server-side with the shared validators.
- Firestore TTL policy on `orders.expiresAt` must not delete `paid` docs — TTL only
  removes docs whose `expiresAt` is set AND still `pending`. (The webhook clears or
  ignores `expiresAt` on paid; verify TTL semantics in the plan — Firestore TTL
  deletes purely on timestamp, so clear `expiresAt` when flipping to `paid`.)

## Testing

- Unit: cart state — add / dedupe SKU / qty clamp / loopDeck qty locked to 1 /
  loopDeck never deduped / `localStorage` persist round-trip.
- Unit: cart Stripe params builder — N `line_items`, `metadata.orderRef` only, no
  per-item metadata cram; mirrors the existing `checkoutParams.test.ts` style.
- Unit: shared validators (`validateLoopConfig` / `validateRecipe`) still pass on
  pack / recipe / dials after extraction.
- Function: webhook with a completed session carrying `orderRef` flips
  `pending → paid` and attaches Stripe fields; legacy metadata path unchanged.
- Function: `createCartCheckout` writes the pending doc with the correct resolved
  `lineItems` + `subtotal`, rejects inactive products and invalid `loopConfig`.

## Rollout

1. Ship `createCartCheckout` + `orderRef` webhook branch alongside the existing
   path (no behavior change to live single-buy yet).
2. Migrate single-buy / configurator / architect to `createCartCheckout` one-item.
3. Ship cart + posters.
4. After production verification, retire `createMerchCheckout` and the legacy
   metadata reconstruction branch.
