# Step Grid Layout Transition — Design

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Status:** Implemented
**Owner:** `src/lib/shared/transitions/layout-flip.ts`

## The problem

Adding a step glided the grid into its new arrangement during the arrival
animation's landing phase. Every other layout change snapped. Austen: *"right
now if I delete a step it immediately pops the pictographs over instead of doing
a shifting animation."*

The cause was three separate copies of the same FLIP technique, each gated
against the others, with delete falling through all of them:

1. **Arrival capture/play** — an explicit snapshot pair, used only by the
   pictograph arrival card.
2. **A history `$effect.pre`** — geometry animation for undo/redo transitions.
3. **Declarative `animate:flip`** on the keyed blocks, whose duration function
   returned `0` while `removingStepIndex !== null`.

Deletion mutated the step array at t=250ms, inside a removing window that did
not clear until t=450ms — so the one path that could have carried it was
switched off at exactly the moment it was needed. `animate:flip` also applies a
single uniform scale, which distorts any cell whose aspect ratio changes.

## The shape of the fix

One owner for "this surface glides from its old arrangement to its new one",
driven by a layout signature.

### `layout-flip.ts` — the capability owner

`createLayoutFlip(config)` returns `{ capture, play, discard, cancel }`.
`capture()` snapshots every tracked element's rect; `play()` measures again and
animates each element from its old box to its new one via the Web Animations
API.

Two things it does that `svelte/animate`'s `flip` cannot:

- **Independent x and y scale**, so a cell changing aspect ratio (a timeline
  cell widening by its duration multiplier, a grid cell reflowing into a
  shorter row) travels without distorting.
- **Spans element families across keyed blocks**, so step cells, the start
  tile, and the mandala cells all move on one clock.

Details that are load-bearing:

- Capture reads each rect **before** cancelling animations still running on it,
  and never issues a blanket cancel ahead of the measuring loop. An interrupted
  transition chains from the position it had actually reached on screen instead
  of snapping to its destination first.
- Animations run `fill: "both"` with `onfinish = () => cancel()`. Without the
  cancel, the held final frame pins a transform onto the element and defeats
  the next transition's measurement.
- Members absent from the new layout (a deleted step, a mandala that only
  exists in the other mode) are skipped — there is nowhere to move them to.
- `getDuration()` returning 0 makes `capture()` decline, so reduced motion
  snaps rather than animating at zero length.

### `grid-layout-signature.ts` — the trigger

A pure digest of the grid's composition: mode, column and row counts, start-tile
presence, timeline row sizes, and step identities in order. When it changes,
cells moved.

**Cell size is deliberately excluded.** A live panel or window drag fires the
ResizeObserver every frame; animating that would make the cells lag the handle
they are following. Proportional resizing tracks the container instantly; only a
genuine recomposition glides.

### `WorkspaceGrid.svelte` — the consumer

One `$effect.pre` compares the signature, captures if it changed, and plays in
`tick().then()`. The three old copies are gone: no `animate:flip`, no
`slideIntoPlace` keyframes and their per-cell stagger, no second geometry path
in the history effect (which now carries only its brightness pulses).

Arrival keeps an explicit `captureArrivalLayout()` / `playArrivalLayout()` pair
because it must snapshot inside its own `flushSync` before measuring the
destination cell. While that transaction is open the automatic capture stands
aside; if the arrival is cancelled between the two calls, the pending flag is
cleared and the snapshot discarded, so a cancelled arrival cannot block every
later glide.

The surface's own `--grid-center-offset` translate no longer transitions. Cell
rects already include the surface transform, so animating both double-moved
every cell.

### Delete timing

`.step-container.deleting` fades and scales to 0.86 in place over
`DURATION.normal`; survivors glide on `DURATION.emphasis`. The 10px jiggle is
gone.

`removeStepWithAnimation` now calls `endRemovingBeat()` immediately **before**
`setCurrentSequence`, drops its nested timeout, and runs its outer timeout on a
named `STEP_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS = DURATION.normal` rather than a hardcoded 250.
`removeStepAndSubsequentWithAnimation` got the same treatment.

A latent bug surfaced while doing this: single-step deletion never played an
exit animation at all. `isDeleting` checked only `removingStepIndices` (plural,
set by `startRemovingBeats`) while `removeStepWithAnimation` calls
`startRemovingBeat` (singular, setting `removingStepIndex`). `isStepLeaving()`
now covers both.

## Scope

Every trigger Austen selected: step list changes (delete, delete-and-subsequent,
mid-sequence insert, clear-to-here), column and size changes, the timeline ↔
grid toggle, and start position add/remove. Every StepGrid host, not just
Construct — the old `activeMode === "construct"` gate is removed.

## Known edges, accepted

- Mandala cells use different dataset keys in grid vs timeline mode, so they
  appear and disappear across that toggle rather than gliding. Steps and the
  start tile do glide.
- An interrupted glide re-captures from its mid-animation rect. This chains
  correctly, and is covered by a test.

## Verification

**Tests.** `tests/unit/GridLayoutSignature.test.ts` (12) covers which changes
fire the signature and which do not, resize exclusion included.
`src/lib/shared/transitions/layout-flip.svelte.test.ts` (9, real Chromium)
covers survivor animation on member removal, start and end keyframes, the
clock, non-uniform scale, the no-op case, the reduced-motion decline, discard,
interruption chaining, and descendant targeting.

The interruption test caught a real defect: `capture()` cancelled its own
running animations before measuring, so an interrupted glide snapped — the exact
behavior the module documented itself as avoiding.

**Runtime.** Measured in a throwaway isolated browser context on the Construct
workspace. Deleting a mid-sequence step produced, per frame:

| t (ms) | What is running |
|---|---|
| 16–190 | Deleted cell's `fadeOutCollapse`; at t=90 opacity 0.409, scale 0.917 |
| 264–523 | Survivors' glide, `duration: 280`, `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` |

Both surviving cells animated simultaneously, both changed geometry, and no
residual transform was left on any cell afterward. A 1920×1080 frame held at
110ms into the glide shows the cells mid-travel with nothing torn or
overlapping.
