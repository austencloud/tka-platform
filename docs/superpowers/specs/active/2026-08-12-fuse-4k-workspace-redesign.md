# Fuse 4K Workspace Redesign

**Status:** Implemented and verified  
**Approved:** 2026-08-12  
**Route:** `/create/fuse`

## Outcome

Fuse must read as one causal workspace at every desktop scale:

1. Blue and Red each provide one closed single-hand LOOP.
2. Independent mode lets either source change without changing the other.
3. Symmetry mode chooses one driver and derives the other source through one
   explicit transformation relationship.
4. The combined preview is the result, not a third unrelated panel.

The 4K tier recomposes the workspace. It does not stretch laptop controls to
fill the extra width.

## Interaction contract

### Source controls

Every editable source exposes these actions without an overflow-menu step:

- Previous
- Regenerate
- Save LOOP
- Saved LOOP
- Shape path
- Adjust path

`Adjust path` opens the canonical shared sequence transformation actions for
Mirror, Flip, Invert, 90-degree rotation, First Beat, and Reset in a compact
popover anchored to the source card. Only First Beat expands into the larger
right-side chooser.

Transforms update persistent SVG pictographs in place. Arrows and props travel
to their new geometry through the canonical CSS transitions; the notation grid
does not crossfade raster cells.

Regenerate creates a fresh one-hand LOOP. Save LOOP persists the current source
as a reusable solo-prop artifact, and Saved LOOP retrieves those artifacts.

### Result actions

The result footer is one aligned action cluster:

- Share result opens the canonical sequence viewer with its Share sheet open.
- Save result persists the combined sequence to the library.
- Open viewer opens the full combined sequence viewer.

Share is the visual primary. No result action floats alone under the canvas.

### Shape paths and prop geometry

The VTG path picker uses the selected side's current prop geometry. A staff-like
two-ended prop previews both traced ends; a club-like one-ended prop previews
one tip. The picker tile and the selected source mandala therefore show the
same path family.

### Independent mode

Both paths remain editable. The relationship summary says that each source can
be changed separately.

### Symmetry mode

Entering Symmetry opens a relationship composer before changing the result.
The composer asks for:

1. the driver source;
2. the transformation used to generate the follower.

The relationship is applied atomically. Until Apply Relationship is selected,
the current Independent or Symmetry result remains unchanged. After applying,
the controls collapse to an equation such as `Blue path → Mirror → Red path`
with an Edit Relationship action. The follower card is read-only and explains
which path generates it.

### Resize seam

The desktop source/result seam supports pointer dragging, double-click reset,
and keyboard resizing with Arrow keys, Home, and End. At the widest tier the
source workbench is capped so the combined result receives the additional 4K
space.

## Responsive composition

- **Below 600px:** keep the existing compact source pair and settings drawer.
- **600px to desktop:** keep the current stacked/tablet arrangements.
- **Desktop:** stacked source cards beside the combined result.
- **Wide desktop:** source workbench capped at 1,400 CSS px; typography and
  targets step up; the preview frame becomes a centered square inside the
  remaining result pane.

Mode controls size to their content and never span the workspace. Source action
buttons wrap at bounded widths instead of absorbing a flexible track.

## Capability ownership

- `fuse-state.svelte.ts` owns source generation and atomic relationship
  application.
- `SegmentedControl` owns mode and driver selection.
- `OptionChipRow` owns transformation selection.
- `SequenceTransformActions` owns individual source transformations.
- `PictographContainer`, `ArrowSvg`, and `PropSvg` own live pictograph motion.
- `Popover` owns the immediate action palette. `CreatePanelDrawer` is reserved
  for First Beat's larger spatial chooser.
- `LibrarySaveService` and `SoloPropSaveOrchestrator` own combined and one-hand
  persistence.
- `SequenceViewerShell` owns sharing; Fuse enters it with a share-on-open intent.
- `SequenceMandala` and the prop-tip registry own prop-aware path geometry.

No parallel transformation or selector implementation is introduced.

## Verification

Functional:

- Relationship draft does not mutate the applied result.
- Applying a relationship commits mode, driver, and transform together.
- Independent mode restores the original two-source result.
- Pointer and keyboard seam changes preserve the canvas floor.
