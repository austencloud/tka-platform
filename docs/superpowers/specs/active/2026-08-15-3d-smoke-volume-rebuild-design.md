# 3D Smoke Volume Rebuild

**Status:** Active  
**Date:** 2026-08-15  
**Owner:** `SceneEffectsManager3D`

## Outcome

Smoke reveals the lingering, buoyant three-dimensional wake of the prop. The
wake remains suspended in world space, rolls into vortices, overlaps itself,
and separates in parallax as the camera moves.

This observable is distinct from Trails (the immediate prop path), Bubbles
(discrete rising shells), Ink (coherent pigment strokes), and atmospheric fog
(a scene-wide wash). If the effect can be described as a softer Trail or a
different Bubble texture, it has failed its slot.

## Evidence and ownership

Search terms: `smoke`, `density`, `volume`, `raymarch`, `Data3DTexture`,
`depthTexture`, `half-res`, `fluid`, `advection`, `vorticity`, `pressure`, and
`billboard`.

Closest owners:

- `SceneEffectsManager3D` owns scene-level effect lifecycle and frame updates.
- `ScenePostProcessing` owns the composed scene render and scene depth.
- `volumetric-fire-mesh.ts` owns the existing object-space raymarch pattern.
- `web-gl-smoke-renderer.ts` owns the 2D fluid solver and its simulation policy.
- `QualityTierDetector` owns device-tier selection.

This work extends `SceneEffectsManager3D`, composes the existing raymarch,
quality, and post-processing infrastructure, and creates a 3D density-volume
solver. The new solver is justified because the 2D solver owns a planar texture
field and cannot represent world-space parallax, volume bounds, or scene-depth
intersections.

This document supersedes the 3D Smoke section of
`2026-04-15-effects-phase-1i-smoke-design.md` and amends the 3D exclusion in
`2026-08-12-fluid-smoke-and-hot-core-design.md`.

## Rendering architecture

### Current WebGL2 viewer

High and Medium tiers use one scene-level renderer backed by a shared 3D
density atlas. Each performer receives one bounded 20-cubed brick in that atlas. All
tracked prop tips for the performer inject density, heat, and velocity into the
same brick. A brick follows its performer in whole-voxel increments while
shifting its fields in the opposite direction, so existing smoke remains fixed
in world space.

The CPU simulation runs at a fixed 30 Hz and uploads an unsigned-byte density
atlas. Crowds above four performers interleave alternating brick sets, giving
each low-frequency volume a 15 Hz field update while the material continues to
animate its sub-voxel detail every frame. It performs:

- semi-Lagrangian transport for density, temperature, and velocity;
- buoyancy and drag;
- three-dimensional curl measurement and vorticity confinement;
- divergence, Jacobi pressure solve, and velocity projection;
- exponential dissipation; and
- segment splats between the previous and current prop-tip positions.

The renderer draws every active brick in one instanced call. A back-face
raymarch accumulates optical depth front-to-back, applies palette absorption and
scattering, samples a short density shadow cone, and adds sub-voxel turbulent
warping. The material writes transparent, non-emissive smoke with normal depth
testing and no depth writing. Close and small-group views retain the full ray
and three-tap shadow budgets. Crowds above four performers use a 28-step High
or 24-step Medium ray budget with a single shadow sample because each plume
occupies fewer pixels at the wider camera framing.

### Lower tier and unsupported contexts

Low tier and WebGL contexts without 3D textures use the existing pooled
renderer with an art-directed turbulent fBm flipbook, animated atlas frames,
anisotropic growth, and palette-aware fading. The lower tier remains a named
renderer with explicit selection, never a silent failure of the volume path.

### WebGPU gate

Three.js now demonstrates a GPU 3D fluid simulation using storage textures.
The production viewer still uses `WebGLRenderer`, so native WebGPU compute is a
separate renderer-migration decision. This rebuild keeps the solver interface
backend-neutral. A WebGPU implementation may replace the CPU/WebGL2 backend
only after the full viewer, export path, and custom shader suite pass parity.

## Preset art direction

The saved intent schema does not change. The 3D translator derives hidden
simulation and material values from each palette.

| Palette  | Injection | Motion                      | Material read                |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Incense  | narrow    | laminar, slow curl          | silver filament              |
| Fog      | broad     | lateral, low rise           | dense cool wall              |
| Genie    | impulsive | fast curl and expansion     | saturated colored scattering |
| Cursed   | medium    | oily folds                  | high extinction, dark core   |
| Spirit   | soft      | long, gentle suspension     | pale translucent veil        |
| Campfire | medium    | strong buoyancy and breakup | warm dense core, cool edge   |

## Lifecycle

- Simulation uses a fixed timestep and deterministic source hashing.
- Pausing freezes simulation with the choreography.
- Disabling Smoke clears its density immediately.
- Seeking, scene replacement, renderer replacement, and disposal clear source
  history so no velocity spike or stale volume survives.
- Offline export advances through the same fixed-step path as live playback.
- Atlas textures, geometry, materials, and field arrays have one owner and are
  released by `SceneEffectsManager3D`.

## Comparison harness

`/test/smoke-3d-compare` uses `InfiniteSequenceGenerator`, requests 16 counts,
and validates the result with `isEffectPreviewLoop`. It exposes honest loading,
retry, and failure states. The harness reviews every Smoke material in the
production viewer across black, Forest, and bright environments with one, four,
and eight performers. It also reports active bricks, source count, ray steps,
density, and CPU solve time while the sequence plays.

## Acceptance gates

1. Smoke is readable at the normal eight-performer camera without zooming.
2. Camera orbit reveals parallax and a persistent world-space wake.
3. No billboard circles, hard volume boundaries, slice banding, or scenery
   bleed-through are visible at normal framing.
4. All six presets are distinguishable within one second.
5. A generated 16-count LOOP crosses its seam without a hold, reset, or flash.
6. Smoke costs no more than 3 ms GPU time at 2560x1440 and 5 ms at 3840x2160
   on the High tier. The lower-tier renderer costs no more than 2 ms.
7. Visual review covers 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160, 1440x900,
   820x1180, 960x412, and 375x667.
8. Unit coverage proves atlas addressing, world-space brick shifts, continuous
   source splats, pressure projection, deterministic stepping, tier selection,
   disabling, and disposal.

## Risks and bail conditions

- **CPU budget:** reduce pressure iterations or simulation frequency before
  reducing the visual grid below the point where the wake reads continuously.
- **Transparent overlap:** performer bricks should not overlap under ordinary
  formations. If they do, migrate the composite to the scene post-processing
  owner rather than accepting order artifacts.
- **Fast camera motion:** reject temporal history on camera cuts if temporal
  reconstruction is introduced.
- **Renderer migration:** do not introduce WebGPU as a Smoke-only side path.
- **Export parity:** any nondeterministic noise source blocks release.
