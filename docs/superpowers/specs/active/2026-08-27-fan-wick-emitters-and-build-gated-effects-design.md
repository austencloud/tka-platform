# Fan Wick Emitters and Build-Gated Effects

**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Status:** Design approved, not yet planned

## The one sentence

A prop's build belongs to the performer holding it, the build decides where the
effect emitters are, and choosing an effect equips the build that can carry it.

## Why

Two defects sit next to each other on the Performers panel, and they turn out to
be the same defect seen from two sides.

**The fire fan does not burn from its wicks.** `resolvePropTipAnchors3D`
(`src/lib/shared/3d/effects/prop-tip-geometry-3d.ts:220`) returns exactly one
anchor for any single-ended prop, expressed as a scalar offset along the prop's
local +Y axis. For the fan that is `FAN_REACH_RATIO` (0.50831 x staff length), a
single point out at the far rim. An off-axis wick cannot be expressed, so all
five collapse into one flame in the wrong place.

This is not a fan bug. It is every multi-tip prop. The triad has three tips in
2D and one in 3D; the quiad has four and one. 3D is the only layer that lost the
count, and it lost it against two existing sources of truth:

- `src/lib/shared/animation-engine/domain/types/prop-tip-points.ts:112` —
  `FAN_TIP_POINTS`, a five-point `dx`/`dy` table. `fire-tip-tracker.ts:277`
  reads it via `getTipPoints(propType)` and feeds all five to the 2D WebGL fire
  renderer, which caps at 16 tips. 2D has burned from five wicks the whole time.
- `static/models/props/fan.glb` — `Fan_Fire_Wick_1..5`, built at measured
  positions by `scripts/build-fan-model.py:660` and already gated by
  `scripts/verify-fan-glb.cjs`.

**Any prop can be set on fire, including ones that cannot burn.**
`src/lib/shared/animation-engine/components/effects-panel/effect-registry.ts:56`
holds sixteen effects and has no awareness of prop, build, or finish. Fire on a
Day fan is permitted because nothing has ever asked the question. The wick cover
belongs in the same conversation: a covered fire fan physically cannot burn, and
that control sits on the same panel.

## What the code forced into the design

### The fan's emitters are build-dependent

The three fan builds are three different physical objects with three different
emitter sets, and one of the three scales while the other two do not.

| Build | Source | Emitters | Scaling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pictograph | `FAN_TIP_POINTS` | 5 rib ends, ~0.418 m at a 32in staff | scales with staff length |
| Fire | `scripts/assets/doodlegrip-fire-reference.json` | 5 wick centres | fixed 48.26 x 33.02 cm |
| Day | none measured — see below | 5 rib ends | fixed 51 x 35 cm |

Measured fire wick centres, prop-local metres, `(across, along)`:
`(+/-0.2217705, 0.10651613)`, `(+/-0.13347299, 0.20877161)`, `(0, 0.25363129)`.

`Fan3D.svelte` scales the GLB by the `scale` prop only, never by
`effectiveLength`, so the fire and day builds are fixed real-world objects. Only
the pictograph plate follows the user's staff length. Wick positions are
therefore absolute metres, following the `CAPSULE_BATON_REACH_M` /
`FIRE_DOUBLE_STAFF_REACH_M` house pattern, not a ratio.

### Build is global while prop and effect are per-performer

`setEffect` is per-performer
(`src/lib/shared/3d/state/avatar-instance-state.svelte.ts:897`). Prop type is
per-performer. Fan build, cover, frame colour and finish are a global singleton,
and `ScenePropPicker.svelte`'s header comment documents this as intentional:
*"which is global — the build a person picks here is the build the scene renders
everywhere."*

Auto-equip has to write that state. Left global, lighting one performer changes
every performer's fans. **Decision: build becomes per-performer.** It is the
consistent model, and it unlocks mixed-gear staging — one dancer on lit fire
fans beside six on practice fans.

## Design

### 1. Build becomes a per-performer override; the global becomes the default

```ts
export interface PropBuild {
  finish: PropFinish;            // fire | day        — triad, quiad
  fanBuild: FanBuild;            // pictograph | fire | day
  fanFrameColor: FanFrameColor;  // black | white
  fanCover: FanCover;            // bare | covered
}
```

- `propFinishState` keeps its current API and demotes from authority to **scene
  default**. It gains a `build` getter returning the current `PropBuild`.
- `Prop3DProps` gains `build?: PropBuild`, falling back to `propFinishState.build`
  when omitted. Every existing call site — Prop Studio capture, collision lab,
  fan-relations, spatial lab — keeps working with no edit.
- `PerformerRig` gains `propBuild?: PropBuild`, passed to both `<Prop3D>`s,
  sitting beside `propLength`, which is already per-performer.
- `avatar-instance-state` gains `propBuild: Partial<PropBuild> | null` with
  `setPropBuild` / `resetPropBuild`, following the exact null-means-inherit
  pattern `prop`, `effect` and `effortId` already use, undo entries included.
- `ScenePropPicker` gains a build seam alongside its existing `accentColor` /
  `showBareHands` props, reading and writing either the scene default or a
  performer's override depending on the host's scope. Its header comment is
  rewritten — it is currently load-bearing documentation of the thing being
  changed.

Six files read `propFinishState` today; two are prop components
(`Fan3D.svelte`, `Prop3D.svelte`).

### 2. Emitters come from the build

`PropTipAnchor3D.axialOffset: number` becomes `offset: { x, y, z }` in prop-local
metres — +Y reach, +X across, the convention `fan-profile.ts` documents. The
two-anchor cap is removed. `resolvePropTipAnchors3D(propType, staffHalfLength)`
gains a `build` parameter and stays pure; callers
(`EffectOrchestrator3D.svelte`, `EffectsLayer.svelte`) already sit where the
build is readable.

`effectTipIndex` stays `0 | 1`. It is the effect-assignment slot, not an emitter
index — all five wicks sit on slot 1 because they are all one end of the prop —
so per-tip effect assignment keeps meaning what it means in 2D.
`TipPositionData3D.tipIndex` is untouched. Downstream renderers already loop over
N tips (`FireRenderer3D.update(tips[])`).

New owner module `prop-build-tip-geometry-3d.ts`, keyed by (propType, build):

- **Fan / fire** — the five measured wick centres as absolute metres,
  transcribed from `doodlegrip-fire-reference.json` with the script cited.
  `build-fan-model.py` bakes `tka_wick_centers_m` into the GLB root extras;
  `verify-fan-glb.cjs` gains an assertion that the TypeScript constants match the
  baked `Fan_Fire_Wick_1..5` positions.
- **Fan / day** — no measured tip data exists. `doodlegrip-day-contours.json`
  holds only a traced `outline` and `holes`; there is no rib-apex table and the
  GLB names no day tip nodes. Derive by normalizing `FAN_TIP_POINTS` and scaling
  it to the day fan's fixed 51 x 35 cm, which is principled rather than a fudge
  because the pictograph silhouette is itself traced from a Doodle-style fan.
  Mark it in code as derived-by-scaling, not measured. If it reads wrong on the
  scene, the upgrade is extracting the five rib apexes from the traced outline —
  real work, deliberately not in this scope.

  Day emitters are not dead weight even though a lit fan is always the fire
  build: trails, LED, sparkles and ghost all run on a day fan.
- **Fan / pictograph** — derived from `FAN_TIP_POINTS`, scaling with staff
  length.
- **Triad (3), quiad (4)** — from their existing 2D tables, which already carry
  the correct counts.
- **Everything else** — today's single or dual axial anchor, unchanged.

Where `prop-tip-points.ts` already has the answer, read and convert rather than
retyping numbers. It remains the owner of emitter counts and positions for
scaling props; the new module owns positions for builds that are fixed physical
objects.

**Velocity history must be re-keyed, or the flames go chaotic.**
`tip-position-bridge-3d.ts:227` keys history as `` `${propIndex}-${tipIndex}` ``.
Because all five wicks correctly share `effectTipIndex: 1`, five emitters would
collide on one history entry and overwrite each other's `prevPosition` every
frame. The resulting velocity and jerk are garbage, and they drive fire poof
intensity, charcoal bursts and trail spawn — so the symptom is not a subtle
one. The key needs an emitter ordinal, and the stale-signature cleanup at
`:198`, which hardcodes `-0` and `-1`, must delete every emitter's entry.

The transform itself is nearly free: the bridge already computes `finalQuat` and
then discards everything but its +Y axis. A prop-local offset becomes
`offset.clone().applyQuaternion(finalQuat)` in place of
`tempAxis.multiplyScalar(axialOffset)`.

Six call sites consume the current scalar shape: `EffectOrchestrator3D.svelte:188`
and `:193`, `EffectsLayer.svelte:242` and `:248`, `tip-position-bridge-3d.ts:190`
and `:208`, plus the `axialOffset` assertion in `sickles-registration.test.ts:45`.

### 3. `buildForEffect(propType, effect, current)`

A pure domain module returning the prop-type and build changes an effect
requires, or `null` when nothing needs to change.

| Prop | Effect | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Fan | fire | `{ fanBuild: "fire", fanCover: "bare" }` |
| Triad, Quiad | fire | `{ finish: "fire" }` |
| Club | fire | equip Torch |
| Staff | fire | equip Fire Staff |
| Staff, Fire Staff | led | equip LED Baton |
| Chicken, Guitar, Buugeng, Hoop, Sword, ... | fire | `null` — burns as-is |
| any | effect off | `null` — the build stays |

The club-to-torch and staff-to-fire-staff cases change `PropType`, but
`SCENE_PROP_FAMILIES` already models these as *builds* of one family ("Club
build", "Double Staff build"), so they are the same user-facing action as a fan
build switch. Swaps stay strictly within a family; never across.

Called from inside `setEffect`, **in the same undo entry**. `setEffect` today
pushes its own entry; a second entry for auto-equip would make Ctrl+Z leave the
effect off with the fans still on the fire build.

### Decisions taken, and what they rule out

- **Effect equips the build**, rather than hard-gating, warning, or doing
  nothing. No disabled chips, no dead ends, no two-step dance.
- **Props with no fire build burn anyway.** Auto-equip fires only where a real
  build exists. Gating a chicken out of fire encodes our missing model as the
  prop's limitation; real fire hoops and fire buugeng exist.
- **The pictograph fan follows the same rule as Day** — fire replaces it with
  the real fire fan. One rule, no carve-outs.
- **Build is per-performer**, not global and not scope-conditional.

## Testing

- Unit: `buildForEffect` across every prop x fire / led / coal, including the
  effect-off and no-build-exists paths.
- Unit: `resolvePropTipAnchors3D` returns five anchors at the measured metres for
  fan/fire, five scaling anchors for fan/pictograph, three for triad, four for
  quiad, and unchanged results for every other prop.
- Contract: `verify-fan-glb.cjs` gates the TypeScript wick constants against the
  baked GLB node positions.
- Undo: effect and build revert together as one entry.
- Visual: the seven-performer fire fan scene, screenshotted, showing five flames
  per fan located on the wicks. Per `visual-verification-mandatory.md` this is
  the evidence, not the test count.

## Risks

**Particle budget.** Seven performers x 2 hands x 5 wicks is 70 emitters where
there are 14 today. `FireRenderer3D` shares one particle pool across all active
tips, so unless the pool scales with emitter count each wick receives a fifth of
the density a single rim flame gets now. Real fire fans do read as five distinct
small flames, so this may be correct rather than wrong — settled during the
tuning pass by looking at the scene, not by arithmetic.

**`@austencloud/scene-3d` is a patched package.** Phase 1 touches
`Prop3DProps.ts`, `Prop3D.svelte`, `Fan3D.svelte`, `PerformerRig.svelte`,
`prop-finish-state.svelte.ts` and the barrel. Follow
`reference_scene3d_patch_workflow`: a fresh edit dir every time, verify the
patch's file set is a superset of HEAD's, and grep the patch and node_modules for
the actual code strings before committing. Five clobber incidents are on record.

## Staging

Three phases, one spec, one user story. **Emitters go first**, not the state
model, because emitters are the only phase that touches no patched package and
they carry the entire visible win.

1. **Build-aware emitters.** Reads the build from the existing
   `propFinishState.fanBuild` / `.finish` getters, which already exist — so this
   phase is confined to app-side files (`prop-tip-geometry-3d.ts`, the new
   module, `verify-fan-glb.cjs`, `build-fan-model.py`) and needs no
   `pnpm patch` at all. Independently shippable, fixes triad and quiad on its
   own, and is the phase that makes the fans actually burn from their wicks.
2. **Per-performer build.** The state model and the picker seam. This is the
   phase that touches `@austencloud/scene-3d` and therefore carries the patch
   risk. Phase 1's build lookup changes from the global getter to the
   per-performer value here — a one-line change at one call site, a cheap price
   for getting the visible fix out ahead of the risky refactor.
3. **Auto-equip.** Depends on both.
