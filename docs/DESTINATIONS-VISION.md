# 3D Destinations: Design Vision

This document defines the purpose, UX model, and future direction for each 3D destination in Flow Arts Composer.

---

## Stage

**Purpose:** Choreography authoring tool. Assemble 3D performers on a stage, line up their movements, assign timings, and build reusable show templates.

**User role:** Director/choreographer viewing from outside the scene.

**Camera:** Orbit (3rd person) by default. You need to see the whole stage and all performers to orchestrate their movements.

**Key features:**
- Multiple performers with independent sequences
- Formation presets (line, circle, V-shape, etc.)
- Beat synchronization and offsets between performers
- Grid overlays showing wall/floor/wheel planes
- Timeline-style choreography editing (future)

**Output:** Show templates that can be used as basis for real-world performances.

## Gallery

**Purpose:** Curated exhibition space. Browse and experience someone's body of work - sequences, compositions, avatars, staged productions.

**User role:** Visitor walking through a museum/portfolio.

**Camera:** First-person by default. You're immersed in the space, experiencing it as a viewer.

**Key features:**
- Creator-curated spaces (they design how their work is displayed)
- Multiple media types: 2D pictograph sequences, 3D avatar performances, full stage productions
- Public browsing of community contributions
- Relaxed exploration pace

**Output:** Appreciation and discovery of community creations.

## Endless World

**Purpose:** Open-ended explorable environment. Originally conceived as procedurally-expanding gallery, now evolving toward more ambitious world-building.

**User role:** Browser in an expansive space.

**Camera:** First-person with free movement.

**Current state:** Experimental. Testing modern 3D landscape generation and exploration.

**Future directions being considered:**

1. **Procedural gallery expansion** - Sequences appear on walls as you walk. The world generates ahead of you, appearing pre-built but actually loading on demand.

2. **Flow arts themed world** - Abstract environment designed around the aesthetic of flow arts.

3. **Flow City** - Urban environment themed around the flow community.

4. **Real-world terrain import** - Recreate actual flow festival locations using Google Maps/terrain data. Specific candidate: **Kinetic Fire** at Hannon's Camp America - a real festival that could be virtually recreated for the community to browse.

**Technical considerations for terrain import:**
- Google Maps 3D data export (Cesium, Google Earth Studio, photogrammetry)
- Height map generation from satellite data
- Texture mapping from aerial imagery
- Legal considerations for using location data

## UX Implications Summary

| Destination | Default Camera | User Role | Primary Action |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Stage | Orbit (3rd person) | Director | Author/edit |
| Gallery | First-person | Visitor | Browse/view |
| Endless World | First-person | Browser | Browse/browse |

## Architecture Notes

Each destination should:
- Persist its own camera preference separately
- Have distinct UI affordances matching its purpose
- Share core 3D infrastructure (avatars, props, animation engine) but differ in interaction model
