## Current interview

**Austen, August 30, 2026:**

> I mean the accuracy of having mocap data over trying to hammer out little
> miniature corrections through an AI model is going to just skyrocket I mean
> my idea is not only will I get animations that I can just place in a scene
> which would be cool enough on its own but would genuinely require me to have
> you know one animation per scene would be very time consuming the broad idea
> is that by gathering the subtleties of human movement such as where fingers
> are in space and how wrists move and how the elbows interact with the staff
> that's passing through the negative space above or below the arm or how a reel
> goes behind the head effectively while the head dodges it would just save me

## Earlier approved first-person material

Austen's approved elevator-pitch source establishes the game:

> Kinetic Archive is game set in a fictional universe where the kinetic
> alphabet is baked into the fabric of reality from the dawn of time.

It describes a museum built by a mysterious bureaucracy, a journey through
fabricated history, real instruction in the Kinetic Alphabet, historical
practitioners portrayed by friends and Flow Arts community members, and a plot
about the organization's downfall.

Austen's community-contribution interview establishes the larger purpose:

> the whole overarching goal is to in fact make it so other people can use flow
> arts in their software

It also establishes the wish to preserve captured discoveries for future
creators while retaining the option to license the complete cleaned production
library separately.

## Verified repository facts

- Flow Arts Composer is an existing SvelteKit web application, not a proposed
  app.
- The repository contains a production 3D sequence-viewer state, multiple 3D
  viewer components, independently controlled avatar performers, and a
  sequence-to-motion conversion path.
- The viewer supports user-controlled camera movement and orbiting. Its playback
  state exposes adjustable speed.
- The existing rig uses inverse kinematics to place an avatar's arms from
  notation-derived targets.
- The avatar-realism audit confirms the current limitation behind Austen's
  description: wrist orientation is not solved, the current target is the wrist
  rather than the palm, finger poses are not authored, and hand-to-prop contact
  is not guaranteed.
- The repository contains Walk Lab, Stage, avatar, environment, and museum test
  surfaces that can supply honest work samples. Their current quality must be
  reviewed before choosing media.
- The museum story bible's explicit Unreal starting scale is three rooms, each
  with one interactive exhibit and a moving avatar. This is a design target,
  not shipped behavior.
- The current project is not yet in Unreal. The truthful portal answer remains
  "No" and the grant project is a defined bridge from an existing web system to
  an Unreal museum-game slice.

## Technical and scope boundaries

- A mocap system should not be described as automatically producing a complete
  AI training set. The response can credibly promise a structured capture
  corpus for direct animation, retargeting, evaluation, and motion-synthesis or
  model experiments.
- Body and glove capture alone will not recover the staff's exact world-space
  trajectory. Credible acquisition requires tracked props or an equivalent
  positional reference, synchronization, calibration, and contact labels.
- Representing the same movement accurately on different body types requires
  retargeting tests and, ideally, performers with different proportions. One
  performer does not prove universal anatomical transfer.
- "Flow Arts movement" is broad. The first corpus should name a bounded prop and
  vocabulary, likely double staff and the body-routing cases Austen identified,
  rather than claim coverage of every Flow Art.
- Motion capture does not replace the notation or procedural system. It supplies
  anatomical examples and constraints that the existing mathematical system
  lacks.
- The grant response should not promise a finished full museum. A funded,
  playable proof should be bounded enough for a solo developer to deliver and
  strong enough to demonstrate the complete bridge.

## Proposed full-details angle

1. **Open with the working proof.** Austen has already built Flow Arts Composer,
   a browser application that turns Kinetic Alphabet sequences into controllable
   3D avatar performances. The current 3D viewer is evidence of execution and
   also exposes the next problem.
2. **Name the problem physically.** The software knows where a hand or staff
   should arrive, but not how a trained body gets it there. The missing data is
   visible in wrists, elbows, fingers, head dodges, negative-space routes, and
   prop contact. Frame this as the boundary between geometric notation and
   anatomical performance.
3. **Explain the capture system, not merely the purchase.** Record synchronized
   body, hand, and prop motion; label contacts and named routing choices; clean
   and retarget the captures; connect each example to the notation and movement
   vocabulary that produced it.
4. **Give the data two jobs.** Use selected captures directly as authored
   animation, and use the larger structured corpus as reference and evaluation
   data for procedural or model-assisted motion generation. This preserves
   Austen's real goal without claiming that one capture session trains a solved
   general-purpose model.
5. **Name a concrete Unreal result.** The strongest proposed milestone is a
   three-room playable Unreal museum slice, matching the story bible's existing
   starting scale. Each room would contain one interactive exhibit and a moving
   avatar, with at least one encounter demonstrating mocap-informed staff
   movement rather than the current idealized IK approximation.
6. **Close on the shared system.** The game is the dramatic proof, while Flow
   Arts Composer remains the working choreography tool. Captured anatomical
   knowledge should improve both: museum characters move credibly, and creators
   can inspect movement from different views and playback speeds while building
   choreography.

## Decisions embedded in this angle for approval

- Treat the Epic project as the bridge between Flow Arts Composer and a playable
  Unreal version of The Kinetic Archive, not as two unrelated products.
- Use a three-room playable Unreal slice as the funded milestone.
- Make double staff and named body-routing cases the first bounded capture
  corpus unless a different prop should lead.
- Describe model use as motion-generation experiments supported by structured
  reference and evaluation data, not as a guaranteed trained AI animation
  system.
- Budget for tracked props, synchronization, calibration, cleanup, and
  retargeting in addition to the suit and gloves.

## Gate status

Austen approved the proposed angle on August 30, 2026. The response may now be
drafted from this source map. Exact portal prose still requires authorship
review and Austen's approval before it is saved or entered.
