# VTG Domain Package: Final Accuracy Audit

**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Package:** `packages/vtg-domain`
**Scope:** Exhaustive accuracy check + structural separation of elemental model from VTG

## Structural Fix: Elemental Model Separated From VTG

The elemental model (Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Sun, Moon) was incorrectly embedded into VTG category data. VTG's creator Noel Yee does not endorse this overlay. The following changes were made:

### 1. `categories.ts` -- `elementalName` field removed
- Removed `elementalName` from the `VTGCategory` interface
- Removed all six `elementalName` values from category entries
- VTG categories now contain only VTG vocabulary

### 2. `elemental-model.ts` -- rewritten with separation framing
- Added prominent file-level comment: "The elemental model is a SEPARATE classification system that maps to VTG categories but is NOT part of VTG itself."
- Added `sourceType` field to `ElementDefinition`: `"community"` for Earth/Water/Air/Fire, `"tka-interpretation"` for Sun/Moon
- Clarified that Sun/Moon are Austen Cloud's unpublished additions
- Each source claim now notes "Community overlay, not part of VTG"

### 3. `cross-domain.ts` -- elemental names removed from output
- `CrossDomainMapping` no longer includes `elementalName`
- `vtgToTKA()` returns only VTG category and TKA letter mappings
- Added file-level comment explaining why elements are excluded

### 4. `index.ts` -- elemental exports clearly separated
- Elemental type and data exports are now in a separate section with comment: "Elemental Model (SEPARATE system, not part of VTG)"

## Accuracy Audit Results

### A. Transition Matrices

**Status: VERIFIED (with one unresolvable gap)**

The four transition types (soft, hard, mixed-1, mixed-2) are correctly defined:
- Soft: hand maintains, prop maintains. Preserves arc/loop character.
- Hard: hand reverses, prop reverses. Creates mirror image, preserves arc/loop.
- Mixed-1: hand reverses, prop maintains. Reverses arc/loop character (C-CAP mechanism).
- Mixed-2: hand maintains, prop reverses. Reverses arc/loop character.

Verified against:
- noelyee.com/transition-theory-with-noel-yee/ (Noel Yee, 2010)
- drexfactor.com/weirdscience/2010/09/29/soft_hard_and_mixed_transition_theory (Ben Drexler)

The transition matrix entries (which transition type connects which categories) cannot be verified from web sources alone -- they require the VTG V1 PDF pp. 6-7 which is not machine-readable. The current matrices are internally consistent: changing direction within the same timing = hard, changing timing within the same direction = soft, changing both = mixed. The asymmetry (SO->TS uses mixed-2 while the other three diagonals use mixed-1) is logically sound as the inverse operation.

**Gap:** The exact matrix entries from VTG V1 pp. 6-7 should be verified against a human reading of the PDF.

### B. 144 Pattern Count

**Status: PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

The current code correctly notes the 144 claim from VTG V1 p.12 and honestly documents that the exact multiplication path is unclear: 16 compound shapes x 3 contexts = 48, leaving a factor of 3 unexplained.

Lorq Nichols' system (spinscience.xyz/324-patterns/) separately describes "144 Atomic Hybrids (16 shapes x 3 presentations x TL/SL/LL)" which uses 16 x 3 x 3 = 144. This suggests the VTG V1 claim may use a similar 3x multiplier beyond just the three L-contexts.

**No change made.** The honest uncertainty note in `THREE_D_PATTERN_COUNT` is the right approach until the PDF can be human-verified.

### C. 40 Patterns (10 shapes x 4 categories)

**Status: VERIFIED**

The 10x4 = 40 derivation is confirmed by noelyee.com/vtg-11-necessity-of-40-patterns/. The 10 shapes and 4 categories are correctly listed. The four named extension patterns (Butterfly, Weave, Buzzsaw, Corkscrew/Windmill) are standard community names.

### D. Contributor Accuracy

| together | CORRECT | -- |
| split | CORRECT | -- |
| same | CORRECT | -- |

| patterns.ts | CORRECT | VTG V1 pp. 3-4, 8-11 |

| documents.ts | FIXED | Transition Theory attribution was "Noel Yee & David Cantor", corrected to "Noel Yee & Jordan Campbell" |
| contributors.ts | FIXED | FireDrums: "co-founded" -> "part owner and founder". Alien Jon CAP: "articulated" -> "popularized and explained" |

### G. Cross-Domain Mappings (VTG to TKA)

**Status: VERIFIED**

After removing elemental names, the letter mappings are:
- SS (Split Same) -> A, B, C (alpha to alpha, same direction)
- TS (Together Same) -> G, H, I (beta to beta, same direction)
- SO (Split Opposite) -> J, K, L (alpha to beta, opposite direction)
- TO (Together Opposite) -> D, E, F (beta to alpha, opposite direction)
- QS (Quarter Same) -> S, T, U, V (gamma, same direction)
- QO (Quarter Opposite) -> M, N, O, P, Q, R (gamma, opposite direction)

These are consistent with TKA's letter-type definitions.

---

## Remaining Gaps (Require Human Verification)

1. **Transition matrix entries (pp. 6-7):** The specific transition types connecting each pair of categories should be verified by a human reading VTG V1 pp. 6-7.
2. **144 pattern derivation (p.12):** The multiplication factor beyond 16x3=48 is unclear from available sources.
3. **Zack Boutilier:** No independent web verification found.
4. **Brian Thompson "Minimal Beat Shapes":** Section attribution in VTG V1 can only be confirmed from the PDF.
5. **Leonardo Icaza elemental model:** Community knowledge but sparse web evidence.
