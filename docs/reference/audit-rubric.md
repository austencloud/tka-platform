# Module Audit Rubric

Loaded on demand by `/audit`. Not needed every session.

## How Audits Work

Audits use a **three-phase pipeline** with structural separation:

1. **Evidence collection** (`scripts/collect-evidence.cjs`) - Deterministic. No LLM. Scans files with regex and produces structured JSON.
2. **Evaluation** (`.claude/agents/audit-evaluator.md`) - Read-only Sonnet agent. Grades from evidence using mechanical thresholds.
3. **Fixing** (`.claude/agents/audit-fixer.md`) - Separate agent. Fixes only cited issues. Cannot grade.

Run audits via `/audit` which orchestrates the full pipeline.

## Grade Rubric (8 Dimensions)

Each dimension is graded A+ through F. Thresholds are mechanical based on evidence counts.

### 1. Architecture

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | 0 barrel imports, 0 Service suffixes, no junk-drawer or stateful-logic utils |
| A | 1-2 naming violations only |
| B | 3-5 violations, or a generic `utils.ts`/`helpers.ts` dump, or stateful logic shipped as loose functions in `utils/` |
| C | Barrel imports or 6+ violations |
| F | God component, pervasive structural issues |

> A `utils/` directory of **pure, stateless functions** named for what they hold
> (e.g. `seeded-rng.ts`, `canonical-json.ts`) is NOT a violation — do not
> downgrade for it. Flag only (1) junk-drawer names where unrelated helpers pile
> up, or (2) stateful logic (cache/lifecycle/deps/coordination) disguised as a
> utility, which belongs in a verb-named service. See the `code-style` skill.

### 2. Code Quality

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | 0 any-type findings |
| A | 1-3 any-type findings |
| B | 4-10 any-type findings |
| C | 11+ any-type findings |
| F | Pervasive type unsafety |

### 3. Svelte 5 Compliance

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | 0 legacy patterns |
| A | 1-2 legacy remnants |
| B | 3-5 legacy patterns |
| C | Store imports present |
| F | $: statements widespread |

### 4. Accessibility

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | 0 violations |
| A | 1-2 borderline findings |
| B | 1-2 files missing reduced-motion |
| C | 3+ files missing reduced-motion |
| F | Widespread violations |

### 5. UX States

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | All 3 states (loading, error, empty) + 0 bare catches |
| A | 2/3 states present |
| B | 1/3 states present |
| C | No state handling |
| F | No states + bare catches |

**Presentational exemption:** Pure presentational components (props in, events out, no async/fetch) don't own loading/error/empty states -- the parent orchestrator does. Grade these on error handling quality only: A+ for 0 bare catches, A for 1.

### 6. UI Consistency

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | 0 hardcoded colors/durations/legacy vars |
| A | 1-3 duration-only findings |
| B | 1-5 hardcoded colors |
| C | 6+ hardcoded colors |
| F | Design system ignored |

### 7. Performance

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | 0 barrel imports, 0 unclean effects, 0 direct transitions |
| A | 1-2 direct transition imports |
| B | 1 barrel or 3-5 effects without cleanup |
| C | Multiple barrel imports |
| F | Barrel pattern throughout |

### 8. Security

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A+ | 0 {@html}, 0 eval, 0 secrets |
| A | {@html} with static content only |
| B | {@html} with unclear trust |
| C | {@html} with user content |
| F | eval() or hardcoded secrets |

## Audit Scope Guidelines

| Request | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| "Audit the Settings module" | All tabs, services, components in that module |
| "Audit the Props tab" | Just that tab component and its direct children |
| "Audit this component" | Single component focus |
| "Full audit" | Entire application (use subagents per target) |

---

## Integration with Existing Tools

- **Evidence collection**: `node scripts/collect-evidence.cjs "<scope>" --out .audit-evidence.json`
- **CSS audits**: `audit-reduced-motion.cjs`, `audit-transitions.cjs`, `audit-durations.cjs` (called by evidence collector with `--scope`)
- **Accessibility details**: `accessibility-auditor` agent
- **TypeScript errors**: `/check` command
- **Architecture issues**: `/monolith` command
- **Styling compliance**: `styling.md` rules
- **Tracking**: `audit-tracker.cjs` (claim, record, resolve-issue, stats)
