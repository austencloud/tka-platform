# Film Director Capability Matrix

<!-- directive-axes: characterId,prop,effect,effort,staffLengthCm,environmentId,formation,leftPlane,rightPlane,stepPlane,stepEffect,stepEffort -->

One row per speakable axis of the `/test/film-director` schema (v4). "Source
of truth" is the live registry/enum — never copy value lists here.

## How this document points at scenes

Nearly every row and rejection below cites a Proving Grounds scene as its
witness. Those citations are **scene ids, linked**, never ordinal positions.
An id is a stable address; a position changes the moment a scene is added or
deleted, and a document full of "scene 19" quietly starts misdirecting readers
the first time either happens. It did: the counterclockwise orbit twin was
deleted on 2026-09-02 and shifted fourteen of them.

Every link opens that scene alone, looping, at
`https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=<id>` — the film
does not play and the other scenes never load. The Scenes button in the
transport is the same catalog as a panel, grouped by each scene's `category`
(camera, timing, staging, performers, props, structure) with the scene's
authored `intent` printed on its card. Proving Grounds is a reference to browse
by subject, not a film to watch front to back.

## Directive-capable axes

These support the full directive grammar (literal, `pick: "any"`,
`pick: "distinct"`, `oneOf`, `not`, `sameAs`) at performer scope, or the
scene-scoped subset (literal, `pick: "any"`, `oneOf`, `not`) where noted.
Grammar and normalization: `src/routes/test/film-director/_lib/directives.ts`.
Resolution: `src/routes/test/film-director/_lib/resolve-film-director-spec.ts`,
`resolve-directives.ts`.

A pick may exclude values in the same breath: `{pick: "any" | "distinct",
from?, not?}` — `not` composes with both picks (and with `from`, which narrows
the pool the exclusion then trims), so "everyone on a different plane, and
nobody on the wall" is one directive. Scene-scoped axes take `{pick: "any",
not}` and still reject `distinct`, with or without `not`.

`stepPlanes` was the first speakable axis that addresses an individual step
rather than a whole performer or a whole scene, and `stepEffects` and
`stepEfforts` now join it: all three resolve once per (scene, performer, step)
— stepPlanes once per hand as well. They differ in how they reach the runtime.
A plane has a per-step setter (`performer.setStepHandPlane`), so the whole list
is handed over once when the scene is applied. Effect and effort do not:
`setEffect` and `setEffort` set the whole performer, so the film reads the
playhead every frame, decides which entry is in force
(`director-step-changes.ts`), and writes only on change. Before 2026-08-24
director scenes could not address individual beats at all.

## Literal-only axes (not directive-capable)

These are real, resolved fields with no directive grammar — either because
they are booleans/records the grammar doesn't cover, or because they are
per-scene camera/scene mechanics with their own dedicated language instead of
the pick/oneOf/not vocabulary.

**Counted time.** Every duration below has a `durationBeats` twin, and camera
keyframes take `atBeats` beside `atSeconds`. Beats convert at the scene's own
`performance.bpm` (default 90) — `beats * 60 / bpm` — before anything else
resolves, so seconds stay the only internal unit
(`src/routes/test/film-director/_lib/director-beat-times.ts`). State exactly
one unit per field: naming both rejects with `State exactly one of
"durationSeconds" or "durationBeats".` (keyframes: `A camera keyframe states
exactly one of "atSeconds" or "atBeats".`). A beat count that converts outside
a scene or transition second bound rejects in the unit it was spoken in — `96
beats at 66 bpm is 87.27s`, not a bare seconds number the director never wrote.
(Beats-stated moves and keyframes have no second bound of their own; a move
total that overruns the scene, or a keyframe past its end, still rejects
downstream with the existing seconds-speaking message.)

A canon spreads one offset across the cast: performer `i` takes `i * n`. On one performer it rejects by name and says to state the offset that performer actually takes. |
| performer `blocking`            | performer                  | literal array of 1–16 moves: `{move: "stand" \| "walk" \| "turn" \| "run", to?, along?, direction?, amount?, facing?, durationSeconds? \| durationBeats?, easing?}` | `blockingMoveSchema` in `film-director-schema.ts` (shape); `src/routes/test/film-director/_lib/blocking-language.ts` (meaning + resolution)                                                  | A move states its length in seconds or in beats — one unit per move, converted at the scene bpm (see "Counted time"). `walk` takes `to: {x, z}` (world point) or `direction` + `amount` (performer-relative); `facing` ∈ `travel`/`hold`/`audience`/`{degrees}` (`audience` faces the default camera side at −Z, NOT the seated crowd at +Z). Travel speed is capped at `MAX_TRAVEL_SPEED` (2.6 m/s) — a faster leg rejects — and below ~0.47 m/s the walk clip hits its playback-rate floor and the feet skate. Deliberately not directive-capable: a path is authored geometry, not a pick. `walk` may bow along a circular path with `along: {arc: "left" \| "right", bulge?}` — `arc` names the side the path bends toward from the traveller's own point of view, `bulge` is the sagitta as a fraction of the chord (default 0.5, a semicircle; bounds (0, 1.5]). The arc compiles into 4–16 straight chords inside `compileBlockingMoves`, targeting 0.5m per chord, so everything downstream still sees ordinary keyframes and `collectStageExtent`'s straight-segment invariant holds. Speed is checked against the ARC length, not the chord. `facing: "travel"` follows the tangent round the curve; any other facing eases from the opening angle to the stated one across the move. Positions and `to` are unbounded — nothing clamps a mark to a stage rectangle, and `stageExtent` grows the ground to include whatever the cast touches — so an entrance is an opening mark outside the frame plus a walk in (scene [edges-of-the-stage](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=edges-of-the-stage)). `move: "run"` parses and rejects by name; see "Spoken but not real". |
| `performance.blocking`          | scene                      | literal `{endFormation, durationSeconds? \| durationBeats?, easing?, facing?}`                                                                     | `sceneBlockingSchema` in `film-director-schema.ts`                                                                                                                                           | Beats convert at the scene bpm; state exactly one unit (see "Counted time"). Cast-wide staging: walks every performer from their opening slot into the named formation's slots — the spoken "and then they all form a line". A performer with their own `blocking` list ignores it. `endFormation` validates against the same formation catalog (and per-count validity) as the `formation` axis.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

See "Sequence directives" below. Deliberately not directive-capable: `mirrorOf` and `transformOf` name one specific performer and `library` names one specific document, so a random pick would have nothing to mean. Rejections: `A sequence names one source…`; `performer "<id>" cannot mirror themselves.`; `mirrors "<id>", who is not in this scene.`; `<verb>s "<id>", whose sequence is already derived from another performer's. Derive from the original instead.` Generation happens after the first frame, so a scene opens on the shared sequence and re-applies when the library resolves. `{source:"none"}` is a performer who stands and watches: `director-sequence-library.ts` gives them no map entry, and `director-viewer-adapter.ts` skips both load paths for their index (`idlePerformerIndices`) and clears any sequence `enter3D` or an earlier scene left on them, so the body idles and no prop renders. Blocking still applies, so a watcher can walk on and stand. Controls reject on it, same as on the demo.                             |

Exclusivity rules enforced by `cameraSchema`'s `.refine()`s (keyframes vs. framing; preset vs. framing; `subject` vs. `target`; `track` only on `subject`; `shots` vs. each of framing/preset/keyframes/target). A performer `subject` may add `track: true` (aim) or `track: "follow"` to stay framed while they walk. Per-move unit/direction contradictions enforced by `validateMove()` in `camera-language.ts` (e.g. `orbit` takes degrees + cw/ccw only, `push-in`/`pull-back` take meters and no direction). `move` ∈ `hold`/`push-in`/`pull-back`/`orbit`/`crane`/`pan`/`tilt`/`truck`/`zoom`/`roll`: `truck` takes meters + left/right, `zoom` takes degrees + in/out and rejects outside 20–100, `roll` takes degrees + cw/ccw, `tilt` takes degrees + up/down and rejects an aim past 85 degrees from level. `pan` and `tilt` turn the rig in place, so they resolve as aim ANGLES rather than an aim point and the sampler sweeps the arc; every other move interpolates the aim point where it lives. Several framings in one scene are spoken as `shots: [...]` (2-16), each a full framing plus an optional duration, joined by hard cuts - see "Mid-scene cuts" under Grammar gaps. |
| camera concurrent moves (`with`) | scene | a move may carry `with: [1-4 moves]`, each stating no duration of its own | `cameraMoveMemberSchema` in `film-director-schema.ts`; the group branch of `compileCameraMoves` in `camera-language.ts` | Every member runs in the parent move's window and its delta is added to the parent's, so a truck riding a crane travels diagonally and an orbit riding a zoom keeps its 30-degree segments. A `with` inside a `with` rejects, a member that states a duration rejects, and `hold` rejects on either side of the group. A member with no easing rides the group's; a member stating a different one has its curve baked into its own progress, because one keyframe stream cannot hold two easing curves at once. A group whose combined lens leaves 20-100 degrees rejects by name with both figures. |
| zoom `amount: {match: "subject-size"}` | scene | a zoom inside a push-in or pull-back's `with`, stating no number and no direction | `cameraMoveFields.amount` in `film-director-schema.ts`; `moveGroupDelta` in `camera-language.ts` | The dolly zoom. The lens is solved each sample to hold `tan(fov/2) * distance-to-target` at its opening value, so the subject stays the same size while the world behind it stretches or compresses. Rejects on the parent move itself, on a member that is not a zoom, on a parent that is not `push-in`/`pull-back` (nothing for it to answer), and alongside a `direction` (the travel decides the sign). Scene [dolly-zoom](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=dolly-zoom). |
| camera `handheld` | scene | `"subtle" \| "steady" \| "rough"`, or `{meters: 0-0.3, degrees: 0-5}` | `cameraSchema.handheld` in `film-director-schema.ts`; `resolveHandheld` in `director-camera-track.ts`; `applyHandheld` in `sample-film-director.ts` | Takes the rig off sticks. Applied to the sampled frame after tracking, so following a walker still follows them. Position drifts inside the metres envelope; the aim drifts inside the degrees envelope, converted to metres at the current shooting distance so a long lens shakes as much on screen as a wide one. The drift is three incommensurate sines per axis, phased from `axisSeedValue(filmSeed, sceneId, "handheld")`, so it never repeats inside a scene, never uses `Math.random`, and replays identically. Works under every camera form including `shots`. Optional and absent when unused, so untouched films resolve byte-identically.

| `pan` `to` a destination | scene | `to: {kind: "performer", performerId} \| {kind: "point", position: [x, y, z]}` | `cameraPanDestinationSchema` in `film-director-schema.ts`; `panDegrees`/`resolvePanDestination` in `camera-language.ts` | A pan spoken as a place rather than an angle. The compiler reads the shortest way round from the current aim to the destination and feeds the existing rotation math, so the rig still turns in place. `to` with a `direction` or an `amount` rejects (state the destination or the angle, not both), `to` on any move that is not a `pan` rejects, and a missing performer rejects by name: `Camera pan references missing performer "x".` Scene [whip-pans](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=whip-pans). |

| scene cues | scene (`cues`) | `Record<name, {atSeconds} \| {atBeats} \| {atBars}>`, up to 16, names `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` | `cueSchema`/`cueNameSchema` in `film-director-schema.ts`; `buildCueTable`/`resolveSceneCues` in `director-beat-times.ts` | A name for a moment. Once named, the name is speakable anywhere a step is (`stepPlanes`, `stepEffects`, `stepEfforts`, `stepStaffLengths`, `holds.fromStep`), as a move's length (`until`), as a camera keyframe's `at`, and as a blocking phase's `startCue`. A cue read as a count is its beat position, because counts advance one per beat; read as a time it is its seconds. Both come from the one stated moment, so one cue drives a step change, a shot boundary and a blocking phase to the same instant. Resolves in `convertSceneBeatTimes` alongside beats and bars, so nothing downstream knows cues exist. An unknown name rejects listing the scene's cues; a cue used as a step that lands between counts rejects with the fractional count; an `until` whose cue has already passed, or whose window has no known start, rejects by position. Scene [growing-staff](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=growing-staff). |
| `performance.phrase` | scene | `"restart" \| "continue"` (default restart) | `performanceSchema.phrase`; `resolveFilmDirectorSpec`'s step cursor; `sampleFilmDirector` | Whether the scene's shared count starts over or picks up where the previous scene's ended (`stepOffset + duration * bpm / 60`). `continue` publishes `performance.stepOffset` on the resolved scene and the sampler adds it to `sequenceStep`, so a tempo change across a cut reads as one phrase getting faster rather than two takes. Optional and absent when the scene restarts. A first scene stating `continue` rejects by name. Scenes [tempo-slow](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=tempo-slow) and [tempo-double](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=tempo-double). |
| `stepStaffLengths` | performer, cast defaults | `[{step \| cue, staffLengthCm: 40-300, ease?: "cut" \| "linear"}]`, up to 16 | `stepStaffLengthEntrySchema`; `resolveStepStaffLengthsForPerformer`; `resolveStepRamp` in `director-step-changes.ts`; `applyDirectorStepChanges` | A prop length that changes during the scene. Read as a ramp rather than a series of switches because the runtime can land between two lengths: `linear` (the default) slides from the previous entry across the counts between them, `cut` snaps at its own step. Same replace-not-merge rule as `stepEffects`: a performer's list replaces the cast-default list entirely. The adapter writes `setStaffLengthCm` only when the value has moved at least 0.5 cm, because the setter rebuilds the prop and a ramp produces a new number every frame. Optional and absent when the prop keeps one length. |
| `performance.blocking` as a timeline | scene | the single staging object, or an array of 1-8 phases each adding `startSeconds \| startStep \| startCue` | `sceneBlockingPhaseSchema`; `assertOrderedPhases`/`movesThroughPhases` in `resolve-film-director-spec.ts` | Cast staging said over time: line up, hold, then open into a circle on the drop. Each phase names its own `endFormation` and the cast stands on its marks through the gaps between phases. A phase with no stated start follows the one before it. Phases run in the order written and may not overlap, because two formations cannot own the cast at once; an overlap rejects naming both phases, and a phase finishing past the scene's length rejects with both figures. A performer's own `blocking` still wins outright over the whole timeline. Scene [two-lines-one-circle](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=two-lines-one-circle). |
| `holds[].progress` | performer, cast defaults | `0-1`, optional | `holdSchema.progress`; `resolveHeldStep` in `director-step-holds.ts` | Where inside the frozen step the held pose sits. A hold pins the performer at `fromStep`; without this the pose is the top of that step, and with it the pose is that fraction through it, so a director can freeze mid-arc rather than only on the count. Absent when unstated, so a film written before this word resolves byte-identically. |
| camera `subject: {kind: "hand" \| "prop-tip", performerId, hand}` | scene | `hand` is `"left" \| "right"` (`"blue"`/`"red"` accepted) | `cameraTargetSchema` in `film-director-schema.ts`; `subjectAnchorHeight` in `camera-language.ts` | Gap 12. Aims at the named performer's opening mark at hand height (1.1 m) or prop-tip height (1.4 m) instead of the group centre. A close-up does not drag it up to face height. The aim is compile-time and does not follow the hand: see the rejection below. |
| performer `propBuild` | performer, cast defaults | `{finish?, fanBuild?, fanFrameColor?, fanCover?}`, at least one part | `propBuildSchema`; `performer.setPropBuild` in `character-instance-state.svelte.ts` | Gap 23. Finish is per performer here, because `effectivePropBuild` merges the performer's build over the global `propFinishState.build`. An unstated build clears the override rather than inheriting the previous cut's. |
| `sequence.level: {ramp: {from, to}}` | cast defaults only | `from`/`to` are levels 1-3 | `performerSequenceSchema.level`; `rampedSequenceLevel` in `resolve-film-director-spec.ts` | Gap 20. The first performer takes `from`, the last `to`, everyone between a rounded step along that line. On one performer it rejects by name. |
| performer `effect: {left, right}` | performer, cast defaults, `stepEffects` | each side takes the full effect directive grammar | `effectValueSchema`; `setHandEffects` in `character-instance-state.svelte.ts`; the tip map in `Viewer3DScene.svelte` | Gap 26. Prop 0 is the left (blue) hand, prop 1 the right (red). A pair keys the tip map per prop; a single value keeps the wildcard. Both sides resolve on the `effect` axis, the right through a separate seeded stream, so a film that states no pair resolves byte-identically. |

## Sequence directives

A performer's `sequence` names exactly one source, and the two generated
sources take controls. "DJ, starting at beta at south, one turn every step" is
`{word: "DJ", startPosition: {group: "beta", location: "south"}, turns: 1}`.

| Source                         | Shape      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{source: "demo"}`             | literal    | The film's shared sequence. Takes no controls.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `{mirrorOf: "<performer id>"}` | literal    | That performer's sequence reflected across the north-south axis (`mirrorSequence`). Takes no controls — a mirror reflects its source exactly, so a control written here would have to disagree with the thing it claims to reflect. Sugar for `{transformOf, transforms: [{op: "mirror"}]}`; it is not rewritten, so existing films resolve unchanged. |
| `{transformOf: "<performer id>", transforms: [...]}` | literal | That performer's sequence with a chain of 1-8 transforms applied in order, each an operation the Create module's Actions panel already owns. Ops: `mirror`, `flip`, `rotate` (`degrees` 45/90/135/180/225/270/315 plus `direction` `cw`/`ccw`), `swap-hands`, `invert`, `rewind`, `start-at` (`step` >= 2). `mirror`, `flip`, `rotate`, `invert`, and `rewind` take an optional `hand` (`left`/`right`/`both`, default `both`); `swap-hands` and `start-at` do not. Takes no controls. |
| `{library: "<publicSequences id>"}` | literal | A saved sequence in the public library, by its document id. Read world-readable and signed out. Takes no controls — a library sequence is already finished. |
| `{word: "DJDJDJ"}`             | 1–24 chars | Spell it. `length` echoes the spelled length.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `{length: 8}`                  | 1–64       | Improvise that many steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Controls, all optional, all on the generated sources only. Each compiles to a
`GenerationOptions` field the orchestrator actually reads — verified call-site
by call-site, because `GenerationOptions.propContinuity` reads like the
prop-continuity knob and reaches neither `builder.build()`.

Notes worth knowing before writing one:

- **A turn figure repeats; an intensity runs out.** `turns` becomes
  `turnPattern`, read modulo its own length, so it still answers at the bridge
  steps the search inserts. `{intensity}` is a fixed-length random allocation
  that leaves inserted steps unturned. Say a figure when you mean "every step."
- **A hand left out of a `{left, right}` figure rests.** `{left: [1, 0]}` gives
  right `[0]`, not the right hand's default roll.
- **`{group, location}` is unambiguous only for beta**, where both hands share
  a point. Alpha has two candidates per location and gamma four, so those throw
  and list them: `"alpha at s" could be alpha1 (left s, right n) or alpha5 (left
n, right s). Name one, or give a {left, right} pair.` Locations accept `n`,
  `north`, or `North-East`.
- **The level gates the turn pool.** Level 1 allows only 0, level 2 whole turns
  to 3, level 3 adds halves and the float marker `"fl"`. A turn outside the
  level names the pool it violated.
- **An illegal directive stops the film at load**, the way a bad `mirrorOf`
  does. An engine that cannot satisfy a legal request still falls back to the
  demo sequence with a console reason.

## Camera orbit direction convention

`orbit` moves take `direction: "cw" | "ccw"`. The convention is the FELT one,
confirmed by Austen on 2026-09-02 against a matched pair of Proving Grounds
scenes: a `cw` orbit that starts from the front ends on the performers'
screen-left end of the line, and `ccw` ends on the screen-right end. In the
azimuth math of `camera-language.ts` (`resolveDirectorCameraTrack`, `orbit`
branch) that means `cw` DECREASES the angle and `ccw` increases it, the
opposite of the "clockwise viewed from above" reading the code originally
shipped with.

The pair existed to be judged side by side while the sign was open. With the
convention settled, the counterclockwise twin was deleted rather than kept —
sixteen beats of a reference film asking a question that has an answer. Scene
[orbit-clockwise](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=orbit-clockwise) is the remaining picture, and the mirror invariant the pair
proved (same start, opposite ends) now lives in `film-library.test.ts`, which
builds the twin inline from the surviving scene.

## Camera roll direction convention

`roll` moves take `direction: "cw" | "ccw"` and accumulate into a resolved
keyframe's `rollDeg`; `cw` adds, `ccw` subtracts. Positive `rollDeg` rolls the
camera body clockwise as seen from behind the camera, so the world in the frame
tips the other way: verticals lean left and the horizon's right side drops.
That is the cinematographer's sense of "roll clockwise" (the camera moves, the
picture counter-rotates) and it was confirmed on screen 2026-09-01 at
`rollDeg: 10` — the camera's local x-axis measured 9.975 degrees off the world
horizontal and the performers leaned left. If a director wants the picture to
tip clockwise instead, they say `ccw`.

The roll lives in viewer state (`viewer3DState.cameraRollDeg`), not on the
camera directly: camera-controls rewrites the camera's position and `lookAt`
every frame, so a one-shot `rotateZ` was erased before the next render.
`Viewer3DCamera` re-applies the roll after the controls' task each frame
(`useTask(..., { after: ORBIT_UPDATE_TASK })`), from scratch — reset `up`,
`lookAt` the controls' target, then `rotateZ` — so it cannot accumulate on a
frame where the controls did not run. A scene's first roll anchors the ramp
with an explicit `rollDeg: 0` keyframe before it starts turning, so the tilt
reads as departing from level rather than snapping in partway rolled.

## Real but not yet speakable

Swept from `src/routes/test/film-director/_lib/director-viewer-adapter.ts`
against the per-performer setter API on the character/performer state factory
(`src/lib/shared/3d/state/character-instance-state.svelte.ts`) and the viewer-level
setter API (`src/lib/shared/3d/state/viewer-3d-state.svelte.ts`). Each of these
is a real, callable setter the director adapter has access to but never calls
with a directed value — it either hardwires a constant into
`buildDirectorViewerSeed` or never touches the field at all.

Per-performer hand plane (`performer.setHandPlane`), per-step hand plane
(`performer.setStepHandPlane`), and plane visibility
(`viewer.togglePlane`/`showAllPlanes`/`hideAllPlanes`/`visiblePlanes`) were in
this table until 2026-08-24 — they are now speakable as `leftPlane`/
`rightPlane`/`stepPlanes` and `location.visiblePlanes` in the directive-capable and
literal-axes tables above. The remaining rows below were reviewed the same day
and each got an explicit ruling, not a "maybe later":

## Grammar gaps

None open. Closed so far:

- **Named cues** (closed 2026-09-02). Before this gap closed, every moment in a
  scene was a number, and the same moment written into a step change, a shot
  boundary and a walk was three numbers that had to be kept in agreement by
  hand: moving the drop meant finding and editing all of them. `cues` names
  moments once, and the name is then speakable wherever a step is, as a move's
  `until`, as a camera keyframe's `at`, and as a blocking phase's `startCue`.
  A cue carries two readings of the one stated moment, a count and a time,
  because a step field wants counts and a duration wants seconds; counts
  advance one per beat, so the count reading is the cue's beat position. Cues
  resolve inside `convertSceneBeatTimes`, the same single pass that flattens
  beats and bars, so no compiler below `resolveScene` learns they exist.
  Scene [growing-staff](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=growing-staff) hangs a prop
  ramp, a camera hold and a freeze off two names.

- **One phrase across a tempo change** (closed 2026-09-02). Before this gap
  closed, every scene restarted the shared count at zero, so cutting to a
  faster take threw every performer's prop phrase back to its first step: a
  tempo change was unspeakable as a continuation and could only be shot as a
  new take. `performance.phrase: "continue"` hands the scene the count the
  previous one ended on, published as `performance.stepOffset` and added to
  `sequenceStep` at the sampler. The count crosses the cut unbroken and then
  advances at the new tempo. A first scene stating `continue` rejects by name,
  because there is no previous phrase to continue.
  Scenes [tempo-slow](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=tempo-slow) and [tempo-double](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=tempo-double) play one phrase at 60 then
  120 bpm.

- **Prop length over time** (closed 2026-09-02). Before this gap closed a
  performer's staff was whatever length the scene set and stayed there.
  `stepStaffLengths` is the first per-step list read as a ramp instead of a
  series of switches, because length is a number the runtime can land between:
  `linear` slides between entries, `cut` snaps. The runtime write is gated at
  half a centimetre, because `setStaffLengthCm` rebuilds the prop and a ramp
  produces a slightly different number every frame.

- **Staging as a timeline** (closed 2026-09-02). Before this gap closed,
  `performance.blocking` was one instruction for a whole scene, so "line up,
  hold, then open into a circle on the drop" needed three scenes with the cast
  rebuilt in each. It now also accepts an array of phases, each naming its own
  `endFormation` and optionally its own start as a second, a count, or a cue.
  The cast stands on its marks between phases. Phases run in the order written
  and may not overlap, since two formations cannot own the cast at once; the
  rejection names both phases so the director knows which pair to move. A
  performer's own `blocking` still overrides the whole timeline.
  Scene [two-lines-one-circle](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=two-lines-one-circle).

- **Where a hold freezes** (closed 2026-09-02). A hold pinned the performer at
  the top of `fromStep`, so freezing mid-arc was unsayable. `holds[].progress`
  fixes the pose at a fraction through the step instead. Optional and absent,
  so films written before it resolve unchanged.

- **Per-step changes: effect, effort, and holds** (closed 2026-09-02). Before
  this gap closed a performer carried one effect and one effort for a whole
  scene and every performer counted the same clock, so changing either meant
  cutting to a new scene. `stepEffects` and `stepEfforts` copy `stepPlanes`
  exactly at the schema and resolver — a per-step entry whose value is a
  scene-scope directive, a performer's list replacing the cast-default list —
  and differ only at the runtime, where no per-step setter exists: the film
  reads the playhead each frame and calls `setEffect`/`setEffort` when the
  value in force changes, with `equipBuild: false` so a step-level effect never
  swaps the prop and `recordUndo: false` so a looping film does not flood the
  undo history (the option added to `character-instance-state.svelte.ts` for
  this). `holds` is literal only and remaps one performer's playhead:
  `resolveHeldStep` pins them at `fromStep` for the stated counts and leaves
  them that far behind afterwards, driven into the viewer's existing
  `performerSteps` host-override seam. Blocking does not pause during a hold,
  and per-step effects read the HELD step, so an entry scheduled inside a hold
  applies for its whole length. Scene
  [per-step-changes](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=per-step-changes) shows both halves side by side.

- **Beats as a time unit** (closed 2026-08-30). Before this gap closed, every
  duration field in the scene schema accepted only `durationSeconds` — a
  director who counts music had to do the beats-to-seconds arithmetic
  themselves and write the result by hand. Every duration field now takes a
  `durationBeats` twin (and camera keyframes an `atBeats` twin), converted
  ONCE at the top of `resolveScene` via `convertSceneBeatTimes`
  (`director-beat-times.ts`), using the scene's own `performance.bpm` — every
  compiler downstream (move windows, blocking, camera) keeps thinking purely
  in seconds and never learns beats exist. A beat count that converts outside
  its field's valid seconds range rejects in the unit it was spoken in, and
  names whether the bpm was stated or defaulted (see "Counted time" above).
  Scene [on-the-beat](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=on-the-beat) states its whole
  clock in beats: a 16-beat scene, an 8-beat camera push, and an 8-beat
  crossing walk.
- **Distinct + exclude in one directive** (closed 2026-08-30). The canonical
  `NormalizedDirective` shape (`directives.ts`) could always represent
  `{kind: "pick", distinct: true, pool, exclude: [...]}`, but the Zod union's
  `{pick}` variant carried no `not`, so no input spelling reached that state —
  "give everyone a different prop, but never LED" was unsayable. The `{pick}`
  variant now takes an optional `not` (one value or a list), and
  `normalizeDirective` checks `pick` before the bare `{not}` form so a
  `{pick, not}` object cannot fall through to the exclude-only branch.
  Scene [combined-draw](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=combined-draw) exercises it on two axes at once.
- **Camera edges: truck, zoom, roll** (closed 2026-08-30). Before this gap
  closed, the camera vocabulary stopped at `hold`/`push-in`/`pull-back`/
  `orbit`/`crane`/`pan` — no move slid the frame sideways without turning it,
  tightened the lens without moving the rig, or tilted the horizon. Three
  moves close it: `truck` (meters, `left`/`right`) translates position and
  target together along the camera-right ground axis; `zoom` (degrees,
  `in`/`out`) adjusts `fovDeg` in place and rejects rather than clamps when a
  request would take the lens outside 20–100 degrees, naming the degrees
  asked for, the fov it would reach, and the fov it is at; `roll` (degrees,
  `cw`/`ccw`) ramps a new `rollDeg` field from an explicit `0` anchor on a
  scene's first roll. `rollDeg` is optional on a resolved keyframe (present
  only where a roll ran, so every film that never rolls stays byte-identical
  to its pre-roll snapshot) and required on a sampled `DirectorCameraFrame`
  (always `0` when absent). Positive `rollDeg` means clockwise as the audience
  sees the frame — see "Camera roll direction convention" above for the sign,
  including that it has not yet been visually confirmed. Scene
  [camera-edges](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=camera-edges) states all three in one breath: a one-meter truck,
  a fifteen-degree zoom, and a ten-degree clockwise roll. A `truck` from a
  framing that looks straight up or down rejects (no sideways to slide along),
  and the sampler holds a flat fov or roll segment exactly instead of letting
  Catmull-Rom bow it toward the neighbouring keyframes.
- **Camera tracks a walking performer** (closed 2026-09-01). Before this gap
  closed, the compiler framed the cast where it stood when the scene opened and
  the camera stayed aimed there, so a performer who walked left the frame
  behind. A performer `subject` now takes `track: true` or `track: "follow"`.
  `true` aims: the camera stays put and turns its target with the walker.
  `"follow"` travels: target and position both move with them, so the framing
  holds constant. The keyframe compiler is untouched — resolution records
  `camera.tracking: {performerId, mode}` and `applyCameraTracking` in
  `sample-film-director.ts` offsets the sampled camera by the performer's live
  displacement from their resolved opening mark (measured from that mark, not
  the first blocking keyframe, so blocking that opens on a hold still tracks).
  `tracking` is optional and absent when unused, so every film that does not
  track resolves byte-identically to its pre-tracking snapshot. Grammar only:
  `track` on a preset's `target` or on a raw keyframe target rejects, because
  those aim exactly where their target says.
  Scene [tracking-shot](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=tracking-shot) follows a
  three-meter crossing with a medium shot that holds its framing throughout.
- **Mid-scene cuts** (closed 2026-09-01). Before this gap closed a scene held
  one framing for its whole length: to cut, a director split the shot into
  separate scenes and rebuilt cast, location, and blocking in each. `camera`
  now takes `shots: [...]`, 2–16 entries, each a complete framing (`subject`,
  `shotSize`, `angle`, `position`, `moves`) plus an optional `durationSeconds`
  or `durationBeats`. Shots that state no duration split the scene's remaining
  time evenly, exactly as moves do; a stated total longer than the scene
  rejects by name (`Camera shots total 20s but the scene's duration is 16s.`).
  `compileCameraShots` (`camera-language.ts`) frames and compiles each shot in
  its own window with the existing `computeCameraFraming` +
  `compileCameraMoves`, shifts the result to where that window sits, and marks
  the last keyframe of every shot but the final one `interpolation: "step"`.
  The sampler holds that step until the next shot's first keyframe, which sits
  at the same instant — the cut — and treats a step as a tangent barrier so the
  Catmull-Rom spline on either side never bends toward framing that belongs to
  another shot. One track out; nothing downstream of the keyframes changed.
  Exclusive with a single top-level framing (`subject`/`shotSize`/`angle`/
  `position`/`moves`), with `preset`, with raw `keyframes`, and with `target`
  (`subject` is spoken inside each shot); a lone shot rejects, because one shot
  is just a framing. Limit: `track` inside a shot rejects. Tracking offsets the
  whole resolved track by one walker's displacement, which cannot describe a
  walker followed in one shot and dropped in the next. Closing this gap also
  made `transition: {kind: "cut"}` instantaneous — it had defaulted to a 0.8s
  dissolve window, which is not a cut. A stated `durationSeconds` still wins.
  Scene [three-shots](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=three-shots) cuts twice inside
  one scene: a wide front two-shot, a low close-up that pushes in, and a high
  medium shot from behind.

- **Sequence transforms and library source** (closed 2026-09-02). Before this
  gap closed a performer could spin the film's demo, a generated sequence, or a
  mirror of a neighbour's, and nothing else. `transformOf` plus `transforms`
  now applies any chain of the Create module's Actions-panel transforms to
  another performer's resolved sequence, and `library` plays a saved public
  sequence by its `publicSequences` document id. `mirrorOf` stays as the
  one-word spelling of a single mirror and is not rewritten, so every shipped
  film resolves byte-identically. The derived graph is validated exactly one
  level deep, the same rule mirrors already followed: a transform of a
  transform has no original of its own to change.
  `director-sequence-library.ts` takes injectable `generate`,
  `loadLibrarySequence`, and `transforms` dependencies with the production
  owners as defaults, caches each chain by its source's directive key plus the
  chain itself, and falls back to the demo with a named reason when a library
  id is missing. Scene
  [derived-sequences](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=derived-sequences) plays one library sequence beside a 90-degree rotation
  with swapped hands and a retrograde of it.

- **Per-performer effect config** (ruled 2026-09-02). Investigated and
  declined rather than built: see "Per-performer effect presets or overrides"
  under "Spoken but not real". The grammar now names the constraint when asked.

- **Scene inheritance** (closed 2026-09-02). Before this gap closed, a callback
  to an earlier look meant retyping the whole scene: cast, location, formation,
  planes, blocking, all of it, with a one-line camera change buried in the copy.
  `extends` names an EARLIER scene id in the same film and the child's raw
  input is deep-merged over the parent's before validation
  (`expand-scene-inheritance.ts`, called at the end of
  `normalizeFilmDirectorInput`): plain objects merge key by key, arrays replace
  wholesale, an explicit `null` on the child deletes the parent's key. `id` is
  always the child's, and `title` becomes optional under `extends` and defaults
  to the parent's. Chains work because the parent is already expanded when the
  child merges over it; cycles cannot exist, because only an earlier scene can
  be named. Expansion runs at the boundary rather than after validation so a
  child can genuinely omit `title` without loosening the schema for every other
  scene. Rejections name both scenes: an unknown parent, a forward reference,
  and a self reference. Scene
  [callback](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=callback) is [combined-draw](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=combined-draw) with one line changed, the camera moved behind.

- **Seed sharing** (closed 2026-09-02). A scene's random draws are keyed by its
  own id, so two scenes asking for the same `pick` got different answers, and a
  callback could not bring the same cast back. `seedAs` names an earlier scene
  id and every axis stream for the scene uses that id in
  `createAxisStream(filmSeed, seedAs, axis)`, so a quoted scene draws exactly
  what the original drew. The resolved scene records `seedSource`. `extends`
  deliberately does not imply `seedAs`: inheriting a scene's text and inheriting
  its dice are separate questions, and a variation that reuses the staging with
  a fresh cast is as reasonable as a callback that reuses both. The Proving
  Grounds callback states both, which is the common case. Rejections match
  `extends`, naming both scenes.

- **A cast of zero** (closed 2026-09-02). `cast.count` bottomed out at 1 and
  `performers` needed one entry, so an empty stage (a location beat, a breath
  between numbers) was unsayable. `count: 0` and `performers: []` now resolve
  to no performers. Group framing has nothing to measure, so it targets the
  stage origin 1.4 m above the floor (`EMPTY_STAGE_TARGET_HEIGHT` in
  `camera-language.ts`), the height a standing performer's chest would have
  occupied, and stage extent is the single origin point. The adapter clears the
  sequence off every pooled performer rather than backfilling them, so a cut to
  an empty stage empties the rigs the previous scene left standing. The default
  when nothing is stated is still one performer.

- **Bars** (closed 2026-09-02). Beats closed the gap between music and seconds
  but left the director counting bars in their head. `performance.meter:
  {beatsPerBar}` (2 to 12, default 4) sets the meter, and every field that
  accepts `durationBeats` or `atBeats` accepts `durationBars` or `atBars`,
  converted through the meter in `convertSceneBeatTimes` at the same single
  point where beats become seconds. Nothing downstream learns bars exist. The
  at-most-one-time-unit refine now covers three units, and a bar count that
  converts outside its field's valid seconds range rejects in bars, naming the
  meter and the bpm: `40 bars of 3 at 66 bpm is 109.09s`.
  Scene [waltz](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=waltz) states a 4-bar scene in
  3/4 at 90 bpm with a 2-bar camera push.

- **Blocking edges** (closed 2026-09-02). Four edges of the staging grammar,
  three of which turned out to be one real capability and two documented
  truths. A `walk` now takes `along: {arc, bulge?}` and bows to the
  traveller's left or right on the way to its mark: the arc is the circle
  through both marks whose sagitta is `bulge` chord-fractions high, sampled
  into 4–16 chords of about half a meter each, with `facing: "travel"`
  following the tangent and the speed check reading the curve's length rather
  than the straight line between its ends. Nothing downstream changed —
  a bowed walk is still a list of keyframes joined by straight segments, which
  is exactly what `sampleDirectorBlockingTrack` and `collectStageExtent`
  already assume. Offstage entrances needed no grammar at all: positions and
  `to` were never bounded, and `stageExtent` already grows the ground to
  include every mark, so an entrance is an opening mark outside the frame
  followed by a walk in. Scene
  [edges-of-the-stage](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=edges-of-the-stage) does both at once: a performer opens five meters off
  the right of the frame and walks in along a left-bending arc to their place
  in the line. The fourth edge, standing and watching, is real:
  `{source: "none"}` gives a performer no sequence, no prop phrase, and an
  idling body, with blocking still applying so a watcher can walk on and
  stand. `run` remains a rejection — see "Spoken but not real".

## Spoken but not real (proven rejections)

Things a director might plausibly ask for that the schema correctly rejects
because the capability does not exist at the scope requested, or does not
exist in the app's control surface at all:

- **A tempo curve inside one scene.** `performance.bpm` is one number for a
  whole scene: nothing in the schema or the resolver accepts a bpm that
  changes over the scene's length, and the sampler forms `sequenceStep` from
  that single value. A director who wants the phrase to accelerate spells it
  as two scenes joined by a cut, the second stating `phrase: "continue"` and
  the new tempo, which keeps the count unbroken across the change. Proving
  Grounds scenes [tempo-slow](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=tempo-slow) and [tempo-double](https://localhost:5173/test/film-director?film=proving&scene=tempo-double) are that spelling.

- **Motion blur.** No shutter or motion-blur pass exists. The whole
  post-processing surface is `src/lib/shared/3d/effects/post-processing/`, which
  holds bloom (`BloomEffect.svelte`), the composer that mounts it
  (`ScenePostProcessing.svelte`), a godrays light store, ocean-specific passes,
  and a color snapshot. Nothing samples across time. A director asking for a
  blurred whip pan gets the whip pan sharp.
- **Depth of field / rack focus.** Same surface, same answer: there is no
  bokeh or focus-distance pass, and the camera carries `fovDeg` only, with no
  aperture or focal-plane field anywhere in `ResolvedDirectorCameraKeyframe`.
  Depth is spoken with shot size and lens angle instead, which is what the
  dolly zoom above manipulates.

- **Per-performer prop color / tint.** No setter exists anywhere in
  `src/lib/shared/3d` or `@austencloud/scene-3d`'s `AvatarSkeletonBuilder` for
  an individually colored prop. The colors seen in the UI
  (`src/lib/shared/3d/components/controls/PropPopover.svelte`'s
  `getPerformerColor(index)`) are a fixed index-based UI accent, not a
  material property that can be assigned.
- **Per-performer effect presets or overrides.** `effectPresets` and
  `effectOverrides` are scene-scoped only. `EffectsConfigState`
  (`src/lib/shared/effects/state/effects-config-state.svelte.ts`) holds one
  configuration per effect id for the whole scene, `applyDirectorEffectPresets`
  (`director-viewer-adapter.ts`) replaces that single state once per scene, and
  `EffectOrchestrator3D.svelte` reads the same config for every performer's
  tips. Two performers on the same effect always look the same; only different
  effect ids look different. Written on a performer or in cast defaults, either
  key rejects with: `Effect presets and overrides are scene-wide: ...` (full
  text in `PERFORMER_EFFECT_CONFIG_MESSAGE`). Making this real means adding a
  performer dimension to the effects state and threading the performer id
  through the orchestrator's resolve calls. That is an effects-engine task,
  ruled out of the director-language campaign on 2026-09-02.
- **Character scale / height, per performer.** `setScale(scale)` exists on
  `AvatarSkeletonBuilder` (`@austencloud/scene-3d`), but nothing in this app
  calls it per performer — the only caller path is the global
  `userProportionsState` singleton (`user-proportions-state.svelte.ts`), which
  derives one character scale for the whole scene from the user's own height/
  build settings. There is no per-performer entry point to override it.
- **Lighting** (per-scene or per-environment light rig control). No schema
  axis, no adapter hook, no setter surfaced to the director path.
- **9+ performers.** `castSchema.count` caps at 8 (`z.number().int().min(0).max(8)`);
  `performanceSchema.performers` caps at 8 as well. Zero is legal; nine is not.
- **`distinct`/`sameAs` on a scene-scoped axis** (`environmentId`, `formation`).
  These concepts require multiple performers to be meaningful; a scene has
  exactly one resolved value. Rejects with the message in the axis table
  above — including `{pick: "distinct", not}`, where the combined spelling
  does not buy `distinct` a scope it never had.
- **Two time units on one field.** `durationSeconds`, `durationBeats` and
  `durationBars` together in any pair, or a keyframe's `atSeconds` with
  `atBeats` or `atBars`, reject rather than picking a winner. See "Counted
  time" above.
- **An environment change within a scene.** `location` is one value per scene:
  the environment is resolved once and handed to the adapter with the scene.
  Mid-scene cuts (`camera.shots`) move the frame, not the world. Cut to a new
  scene to change the place, and `extends` makes that cheap.
- **More than 24 scenes, or a scene longer than 60 seconds.**
  `filmSchema.scenes` caps at 24 entries and a scene's `durationSeconds` caps
  at 60 (`durationBars` at 120 bars, `durationBeats` at 240, both converting
  into the same seconds bound). These are workbench limits, not physics: a
  film is a demonstration reel here, not a feature.
- **A nonexistent character, prop, effect, effort, environment, or formation
  name.** Every axis validates against its live catalog and rejects by name
  (see the "Rejection behavior" column above) — there is no silent fallback.
- **`run` (and any gait faster than a walk).** `move: "run"` parses and then
  rejects by name. `@austencloud/scene-3d`'s `LocomotionAnimator` has one walk
  clip bank and no run or jog state — its own state machine comment reads
  `idle <-> walk (4-way directional) <-> jump/fall/land/crouch` — and
  `analyzeClipGait` time-warps that single clip's playback rate to match ground
  speed rather than switching gaits. `MAX_TRAVEL_SPEED` (2.6 m/s) is the point
  where that warp gives out and the feet skate, so "faster than a walk" is
  already the failure the blocking compiler guards against, not a mode it can
  select. Rejection: `Performer "<id>": "run" is not a gait the 3D locomotion
  has. There is one walk clip, time-warped to the ground, and past 2.6 m/s the
  feet skate. Write a "walk".` Adding a run would mean importing run clips into
  the scene package first, which `.claude/rules/locomotion.md` puts outside this
  workbench.


- **A camera aim that follows a hand or prop tip through the phrase** (gap 12,
  ruled 2026-09-02). `subject: {kind: "hand" | "prop-tip"}` is real, but it aims
  at the performer's mark at the right height and holds there. Live hand world
  positions exist only inside `PerformerRig`'s `effectsSlot` snippet in
  `@austencloud/scene-3d` and are consumed inline in
  `src/lib/shared/3d/components/Viewer3DScene.svelte`; nothing publishes them to
  `viewer-3d-state.svelte.ts`, which is the only handle the director adapter
  holds. `leftPropState.worldPosition` is a grid-local prop centre, not a world
  hand position, so deriving one would duplicate the package's plane and grid
  transform. Blocking file: the `effectsSlot` boundary in
  `Viewer3DScene.svelte`. Reaching it needs a package change, which this wave
  does not take.

- **Postures and stances as a directed axis** (gap 24, ruled 2026-09-02). The
  scene package owns `setActiveState`, but no per-performer posture trigger is
  surfaced on `character-instance-state.svelte.ts`, so there is nothing for the
  adapter to call. Blocking file: `character-instance-state.svelte.ts` (no
  posture setter).

- **Gaze** (gap 25, ruled 2026-09-02). `headLookAt` is a rig input with no
  writer anywhere in the product: nothing in `src/lib/shared/3d` sets it, so a
  schema axis would resolve into a value no runtime reads. Blocking file: the
  `headLookAt` input on `PerformerRig` in `@austencloud/scene-3d`.

- **Lighting as a directed axis** (gap 27, ruled 2026-09-02). There is no
  runtime lighting setter on the viewer state; environment light rigs are
  authored inside each scene component. Unchanged from the 2026-08-24 ruling in
  "Real but not yet speakable" above.

- **Clock-synced audio** (ruled 2026-09-02). No audio owner reads the film's
  playhead, so a stated cue could not be heard on the beat it names. Adding one
  is a product decision, not a grammar gap.
