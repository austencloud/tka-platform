# Google Merchant Center Setup

Why this exists: "kinetic alphabet" gets spell-corrected to "phonetic alphabet" in Google.
The fix is entity establishment, not a Google Business Profile (online-only shops are
ineligible for GBP, and GBP only affects Maps/local results anyway). Merchant Center is
the legitimate "register with Google as a business" path for tkaflowarts.com: it puts the
decks in free Shopping listings and adds a strong brand-entity signal tied to the domain.

## Already in place (verified 2026-07-16)

- **Search Console verification**: `static/googlec954fc3d206e6f49.html` is live, so
  tkaflowarts.com is verified under a Google account Austen controls. Merchant Center
  claims the website through this same verification. One click, no new DNS work.
- **Product structured data** on every shop surface, server-rendered (Merchant Center
  requires it in the initial HTML, not injected by JS):
  - `/shop/loop-deck`: Product + AggregateOffer ($35 preorder to $55 Architect regular),
    PreOrder availability, NewCondition
  - `/shop/tnd-trilogy`: Product + AggregateOffer ($30 x 3 volumes), InStock, NewCondition
  - `/shop/[productId]`: Product + Offer with live price/availability from the catalog
  - All carry `brand: The Kinetic Alphabet`
- **Organization entity** on the homepage with `disambiguatingDescription` (explicitly
  distinguishing from the NATO phonetic alphabet) and `knowsAbout`.

## What only Austen can do

Account creation and identity verification run through his Google account. Everything
below is prepared so those sessions are fill-in-the-blanks.

## Setup steps

1. Go to [merchants.google.com](https://merchants.google.com) signed in as
   austencloud@gmail.com and choose "Create account".
2. Business name: `The Kinetic Alphabet`. Country: United States. Time zone: America/Chicago.
3. Website: `https://tkaflowarts.com`. When asked to verify, pick "Search Console" and
   select the existing verified property. Claim completes immediately.
4. Business info:
   - Description: see "Profile copy" below
   - Customer support email: `support@tkaflowarts.com`
   - Address: Google requires one for identity verification. A home address works and
     can be kept non-public (Merchant Center does not publish it the way a Business
     Profile would).
5. Products: with a 3-listing catalog, add products manually in the UI rather than
   engineering a feed. For each product enter title, description, link, image, price,
   availability, condition (new). Values below. Alternative: choose "website crawl" as
   the feed source and let Google read the on-page structured data; both work, manual is
   more predictable at this size.
6. Shipping: flat-rate or table matching whatever the Stripe checkout charges. Keep it
   in sync with the shop; mismatches between site and Merchant Center trigger
   disapprovals.
7. Enable free listings (Growth > Manage programs > Free listings). Do NOT set up paid
   Shopping ads; not needed for the entity goal.
8. After approval, confirm products show under "All products" as Active, then check
   Search Console > Shopping tab for the merchant listing reports.

## Profile copy

Business description:

> The Kinetic Alphabet (TKA) is a notation system for flow arts. It gives prop spinners
> a written alphabet for choreography: compose sequences in the free web app, then read
> them back like sheet music. The shop sells printed choreography card decks generated
> from the notation, including the LOOP Deck and the Timing & Direction Trilogy.

## Product values

| Field | LOOP Deck | Timing & Direction Trilogy (per volume) |
|---|---|---|
| Title | LOOP Deck: 54 Flow Sequence Playing Cards | TKA 1/2/3 (Learning Letters / Writing Words / Speaking Sentences) |
| Link | https://tkaflowarts.com/shop/loop-deck | https://tkaflowarts.com/shop/tka-1-learning-letters (etc.) |
| Price | $35.00 (preorder; $45 regular after 2026-09-30) | $30.00 |
| Availability | preorder | in_stock |
| Condition | new | new |
| Category | Arts & Entertainment > Hobbies & Creative Arts | same |
| Description | 54 flow sequences printed as playing cards. Pick a transformation flavor and build your LOOP deck. | Three printed decks, every card color-coded by its timing and direction family. |

Preorder note: Merchant Center preorder availability requires an availability date.
The site's stated ship date is October 1 (LoopDeckConfiguratorPage/DeckArchitectPage:
"Preorder now. Decks ship October 1."), so enter **2026-10-01**. Update if it slips.

Product identifiers: the decks are small-batch handmade prints with no GTIN/UPC. Check
"I don't have a GTIN, UPC, EAN, JAN or ISBN" and let Google auto-assign, or enter the
listing slug (loop-deck, tka-1-learning-letters, ...) as the SKU.

Shipping values (source of truth: `firebase-functions/src/merch/checkoutParams.ts`):
US free, Canada $14.00, International $25.00, worldwide address collection.

Product images: do NOT use `/branding/og-image.png` — it is the app marketing banner
(headline, CTA buttons, FREE badge) and violates the no-promotional-overlay image
policy. Merchant-ready images composed from the real card renders live in
`C:/Users/Austen/Downloads/merchant-images/`:

- `loop-deck-fan.png` (2200x1800, five real cards fanned, white background) plus
  `loop-deck-card.png` (single card, 822x1122) as an additional view
- `tka-1-learning-letters.png`, `tka-2-writing-words.png`,
  `tka-3-speaking-sentences.png` (same fan treatment from the baked shop covers)

Known bug found while capturing (2026-07-16): the baked shop covers for TKA 3 on
Firebase Storage are byte-identical to TKA 2's (verified by sha256 of
`shop-covers/tka-2.../0.png` vs `shop-covers/tka-3.../0.png`). TKA 3 should show
half-turn variations. The coverCards reseed ran but the PNG bake for tka-3 did not.
Re-run the cover bake for tka-3-speaking-sentences, then regenerate its merchant image.

## Not doing (and why)

- **Google Business Profile**: online-only businesses without in-person customer contact
  are ineligible; 2026 video verification checks signage and interior at the claimed
  address. Attempting it risks suspension and publishes a home address. It also would
  not affect the phonetic-alphabet autocorrect, which is a web-search entity problem.
- **Wikidata entry**: strongest Knowledge Graph lever, but entries without independent
  published coverage get deleted. Revisit after press / Kickstarter coverage exists to
  cite.
