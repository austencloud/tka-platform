# Responsive Design Strategy

TKA supports small phones, tablets, ordinary desktop windows, and wide high-density displays. This is the working architecture reference. The governing design is [Logical-Pixel Responsive Composition](../superpowers/specs/active/2026-08-27-logical-pixel-responsive-composition-design.md).

## The model

Responsive design has four independent concerns:

1. **Logical size**: controls and type use CSS pixels and `rem`. A wider viewport does not imply a more distant viewer.
2. **Composition**: available inline space can change columns, rails, gutters, and content bands.
3. **Reading measure**: prose keeps a comfortable line length instead of stretching across the canvas.
4. **Presentation distance**: larger viewing-distance UI is an explicit mode, not something inferred from viewport width or device-pixel ratio.

Windows display scaling and browser zoom already map logical CSS pixels to a comfortable physical size. A 3840×2160 panel at 150% scaling commonly exposes about 2560×1440 CSS pixels. Do not magnify that viewport again.

## Typography roles

Typography is stable across desktop widths. Use the global role tokens from `src/app.css` rather than redefining them inside a large-screen query.

| Role                | Token                 | Default         |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Compact metadata    | `--font-size-compact` | 0.75rem / 12px  |
| Secondary UI        | `--font-size-sm`      | 0.875rem / 14px |
| Primary UI and body | `--font-size-base`    | 1rem / 16px     |
| Emphasized UI       | `--font-size-lg`      | 1.125rem / 18px |
| Section heading     | `--font-size-xl`      | 1.25rem / 20px  |

Essential UI copy should not fall below 14px. Supplementary metadata may use 12px. Browser zoom scales these roles; viewport width does not.

## Who owns a responsive decision

- Use **container queries** when a component is reacting to the space its parent gives it. Examples: card columns, a detail pane, or a rail that becomes a mobile card list.
- Use **media queries** when the viewport changes the page shell or input model. Examples: the app sidebar, safe-area padding, or a full-screen mobile modal.
- Use bounded `clamp()` values for geometry that genuinely benefits from small fluid adjustment. Do not use viewport-driven `font-size` or redefine global type tokens to magnify a subtree.

The 1680px and 2600px thresholds are composition vocabulary, not scale modes. They may add a column, widen a capped content band, or reveal an auxiliary rail. They must not make the same control or sentence larger solely because the canvas is wider.

## Public and editorial pages

Public pages use one capped shell variable, `--shell-w`, for composition. Full-bleed backgrounds may span the viewport while authored content remains in the shell.

Editorial copy uses the shared measures in `src/lib/shared/landing/styles/editorial-measure.css`:

- prose: `68ch`
- lede: `54ch`
- notes and captions: `60ch`

These are maximum measures, not fixed widths. They collapse naturally on small screens. Feature grids and visual showcases may be wider than prose without increasing root type size.

## Authenticated app

The app keeps the standard 16px root at every desktop width. Responsive rules may recompose the workspace but may not create a second large-screen typography system.

Workspace artifacts such as a stage, pictograph, timeline, or map can use container-relative geometry when the artifact itself benefits from more room. Keep its controls, labels, dialogs, and surrounding prose on the global UI roles.

## Mobile

Mobile and desktop keep functional parity while allowing different layouts. Use the owning shell or component's actual constraint, not one universal mobile breakpoint. Preserve touch targets, safe areas, and readable type even when controls reflow or become full-screen.

## Modals

Use `BaseModal` and the size variants in `modal-tokens.css` before adding custom widths. Modal size controls the content band; it does not authorize a local type ramp. Components inside a modal should react to the modal body with container queries.

## Verification matrix

Every responsive visual change is checked at these CSS viewports:

| Class                                              | Viewport  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Small phone                                        | 375×667   |
| Wide phone, landscape                              | 960×412   |
| Tablet                                             | 820×1180  |
| Compact desktop                                    | 1440×900  |
| Desktop                                            | 1920×1080 |
| High-density desktop at 150% OS scaling equivalent | 2560×1440 |
| Native 4K CSS canvas                               | 3840×2160 |

Also check 200% browser zoom for keyboard reachability, clipping, and reflow. Verification records the CSS viewport and computed root font size so a physical panel resolution is never mistaken for a CSS layout width.

## Known-good owners

- `ReleaseNotesTab.svelte`: desktop rail plus container-driven mobile history cards, with stable type roles
- `BaseModal.svelte` and `modal-tokens.css`: modal sizing and mobile fallback
- `public-editorial.css` and `editorial-measure.css`: public reading measure
- `SequenceViewerShell.svelte`: an artifact shell whose visual workspace can grow without magnifying generic UI
