# ADR: Crossfade Primitive and the Crossfade Boundary

**Date:** 2026-06-30
**Status:** Accepted
**Context loaded:** on demand (not every session)

## Decision

There are two sanctioned crossfade primitives. Every _true crossfade_ of cheap
content uses `src/lib/shared/components/Crossfade.svelte`. Heavy/stateful
content uses `src/lib/shared/components/DualSourceCrossfade.svelte`, the
dual-source no-remount path.
Single enter/exit fades stay plain `transition:fade`. The boundary between these
three is recorded here so future work doesn't re-litigate it.

Enforced routing summary lives in `.claude/rules/crossfade-primitive.md`; this
doc is the rationale.

## Why

Crossfades were repeatedly hand-rolled as two in-flow siblings each with
`transition:fade`. Both stay in normal flow during the transition, so they stack,
take each other's space, and shove neighbors — layout shift across the whole
transition. The grid-stack fix (both layers pinned to one cell) was known and
copied around in feature code, but with no primitive to reach for, each new
crossfade re-derived it and often got it wrong. Austen (2026-06-30): _"this has
already been solved time and time again in our code base."_

## The boundary (the load-bearing decision)

Two independent axes decide where a fading thing belongs. Conflating them is the
mistake that produced both the bug and the over-correction.

### Axis 1 — Is it even a crossfade?

A **true crossfade** has two mutually-exclusive states that swap in the same box
(`{#if a}…{:else}…{/if}` or `{#key}`-driven). A **single enter/exit** fade has no
second state — a modal appears, a toast dismisses, a panel mounts. Single fades
are NOT crossfades. Wrapping one in `<Crossfade>` means inventing a meaningless
`key` and makes the code lie about its intent. They stay plain `transition:fade`.

### Axis 2 — Remount cost (only for true crossfades)

`<Crossfade>` is `{#key}`-based, so it REMOUNTS children on every change.

- **Cheap content** (labels, icons, status words, light panels): remount is free.
  → `<Crossfade>`.
- **Heavy/stateful content** (canvas, large pictograph render, a panel holding
  scroll position / focus / in-progress export): remount drops that state and
  costs a paint. → `<DualSourceCrossfade>`, which keeps two host-prepared
  sources mounted and animates opacity only after the replacement is ready.
  Never `{#key}` the visible source. Hosts retire the outgoing source from the
  primitive's `onsettled` event, not from a timer, so teardown follows the
  compositor's real endpoint even when a frame arrives late.

### Sizing is a primitive option, not a boundary

Similarly sized content (default grid mode), materially different natural
heights (`animateHeight`), and parent-filled layers (`fill` → `absolute; inset:0`)
are primitive options. They do NOT decide the boundary — remount cost does.
`animateHeight` measures the incoming layer and eases the wrapper to it on the
same clock as the fade, in either direction. A parent-filled crossfade of cheap
content is fine on the primitive (`fill`); a parent-filled crossfade of heavy
content is not (regardless of `fill`).

## What is on the primitive (migrated 2026-06-30)

| File                                             | Mode              | Note                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `landing/SpinnerStatsBar`                        | grid, crossfade   | flex stat sets, real shift bug fixed                                |
| `tool-panel/ToolPanel` sub-tab                   | `fill`, crossfade | heavy but already keyed; gained reduced-motion                      |
| `mandala/MandalaLoader`                          | `fill`            | parent-filled stage, already cycles                                 |
| `generate/GenerateEmptyState`                    | grid, `delay=120` | tuned stagger preserved via `delay`                                 |
| `navigation/profile-settings/PasswordChangeForm` | `animateHeight`   | compact trigger ↔ credential form; symmetric expansion and collapse |

Consolidation tax accepted: bespoke asymmetric in/out durations (e.g. in 260 /
out 180) collapse to one `DURATION.*` token. Differences are imperceptible;
removing micro-timings is the point. The one perceptible tuning (the 120ms
delayed-in stagger) is preserved via the `delay` prop.

## Deliberate carve-outs (NOT migrated)

- `CellRenderer` + `crossfader-state` — specialized bitmap/URL dual-source
  path; it retains its focused image lifecycle and dark-mode coordination.
- `FuseTab`, `CreationWorkspaceArea` — heavy non-keyed view/workspace swaps;
  `{#key}` remount too costly.
- `ButtonPanel` center-zone — absolutely centered against the whole panel (a
  third sizing the primitive does not model) with load-bearing container-query
  CSS on the faded element; migrating shifts the button's center.
- ~30 single enter/exit fades — not crossfades.

## Enforcement

Rule + memory, deliberately NOT an automated lint/grep. A regex cannot reliably
distinguish a true two-sibling crossfade from a single enter/exit fade without
heavy false positives, and a noisy gate is worse than none (cross-ref
`component-test-discipline.md`). The signal is carried by:
`.claude/rules/crossfade-primitive.md`, the `Crossfade.svelte` header doc, and
memory `feedback_crossfade_no_layout_shift`.

## Consequences

- One place to evolve crossfade behavior; new crossfades have an obvious home.
- A future agent reading any `transition:fade` has a rule that tells it whether a
  crossfade is owed.
- The carve-outs are explicit, so "why isn't X on the primitive" is answered here
  rather than re-discovered.
