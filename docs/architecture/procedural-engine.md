# Procedural World Engine

Lives at `src/lib/shared/3d/procedural-engine/`. Shared infrastructure for every 3D surface that wants terrain streaming, vegetation scatter, atmosphere, water, GPU compute, ECS, or worker-based chunk generation. It is not tied to any destination.

## Destinations that consume it

A destination is a `.svelte` component that composes `WorldScene` (or lower-level engine primitives) with its own world configuration. Each destination lives in its own feature folder:

- `features/campground/CampgroundDestination.svelte` — procedural forest clearing
- `features/hannons-camp/HannonsCampDestination.svelte` — Flow Fest Sim's checked geospatial manifest and binary terrain
- `features/archive/ArchiveDestination.svelte` — curated indoor scene (does not use the procedural engine, uses `IndoorScene` instead)
- `features/museum/scenes/procedural/MuseumDestination.svelte` — procedural museum walk mode of the museum feature
- `features/lab/tools/3d-controls/ThreeDControlsLab.svelte` — prop/motion tuning lab

All are registered in `shared/3d/destinations/definitions.ts`.

`shared/3d/StageWorld.svelte` also composes engine primitives directly for the sequence viewer's Stage mode.

## Data ownership

The engine does not know about destination-specific data. When a destination needs real-world terrain, it loads and validates its own manifest and binary field, then passes normalized `terrainData` to `WorldScene`. `WorldSceneContent` consumes the prop; it does not import or fetch destination files itself.

## Why it lives under shared/

Campground, Hannon's Camp, and the 3D Museum scene all need the engine. The sequence viewer's Stage mode needs it too. Putting shared infrastructure inside a feature folder (as it was previously under `features/realm/`) forced every consumer to either cross feature boundaries or duplicate the engine. Moving it to `shared/3d/procedural-engine/` eliminates that coupling.
