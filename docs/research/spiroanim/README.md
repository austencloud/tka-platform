# SpiroAnim → TKA: full transcription

Complete transcription of Mentive's **SpiroAnim** pattern space into TKA
letters. Source: [rbgirard/spiroanim](https://github.com/rbgirard/spiroanim),
a Vue 3 + Three.js poi/staff animator (`PTEXT = ['POI', 'Staff']`).

Produced 2026-08-09. Purpose: give TKA a measured, poi-grounded corpus —
specifically to source **poi-legal** content, since
`docs/reference/poi-legality.md` records the transition layer as having no data
at all.

An additional 2026-08-23 artifact covers a hand-authored v9 editor link rather
than a concept-builder cell. Its 45-degree frame arcs pair into 24 TKA
dual-shifts, each carrying 0.25 turns. The position cycle closes after 12 steps;
the repeated second pass closes the eight-state orientation cycle. See
`editor-v9-quarter-turn-club-loop.json` for the complete motion record and the
original SpiroAnim URL.

## Attribution

The Eight Step handpaths are **Gage's source data**, re-paginated by Mentive
(his `docs/EIGHT_STEP.md` documents the correction). The VTG matrix descends
from Noel Yee's Vulcan Tech Gospel (2010). Nothing here is TKA-original; it is
a transcription of other people's systems into TKA's vocabulary. Credit them on
any surface built from this. See `.claude/rules/no-fabrication.md` and the
`feedback_source_tiering` memory.

## Method

His own builders and compiler were the oracle — nothing was reimplemented, so
there is no risk of grading our own homework.

1. Clone, `npm install`, add a vitest spec importing `buildVtgPattern`,
   `createVtgPreviewAnimation`, `createQtrPreviewAnimation`, and
   `createEightStepPreviewAnimation`; enumerate every cell × option.
2. Run each result through **his** `rootCompile()`, and each compiled frame's
   `pos`/`rot` vectors through **his** `closestPoint()` to recover named grid
   points (`MTC`, `MR`, …).
3. Map those to TKA compass (`MTC→n`, `MR→e`, `MBC→s`, `ML→w`, and the four
   intercardinals), then resolve `(startPosition, endPosition, motionTypes,
   locations)` against `static/data/pictographs/{Diamond,Box}PictographDataframe.csv`.
   **Position names and letters both come from the dataframes** — no TKA
   numbering was invented.

Motion mapping, verified against MCP `get_term_definition("turns")` ("0 turns
with pro shift: prop rotates 90 degrees") and confirmed empirically against his
generator:

| His curve family | prop rotation / 90° hand arc | TKA |
|---|---|---|
| Extension | +90° | pro, 0 turns |
| Inspin | +270° | pro, 1 turn, ori **in** |
| Outspin | +270° | pro, 1 turn, ori **out** |
| Antispin | −270° | anti, 1 turn |

Inspin and outspin differ only by starting phase — exactly `Flower.ori`.

## Result

**1,584 transcribed patterns, 8,640 steps, 100% resolved to TKA letters. Zero
unresolved.** A further 1,728 entries for the 1:2, 1:4, 2:3 and 2:5 ratios
were derived from those on 2026-09-01 (see `bridge.md` → Speed ratios), for
3,312 entries in the file.

The concept ↔ position mapping is exact, with no exceptions across the corpus:

| His concept | TKA letters | TKA positions |
|---|---|---|
| `vtg` (6×6, 7 speed ratios) | **A–L** (SS=ABC, TO=DEF, TS=GHI, SO=JKL) | alpha / beta |
| `qtr` (quarter spacing) | **M–V** (QO=M–R, QS=S–V) | gamma |
| `eight-step` (8×9) | all 22 | all three |

His entire application is **TKA Type 1 (dual-shift) and nothing else** — 22 of
47 letters. Structural facts measured over the corpus:

- every hand arc is exactly 90° (one adjacent-cardinal shift), 15,552/15,552
- at 1:1/1:3/1:5, prop rotations are only ±90/±270/±450 → integer turns 0–2;
  the even-denominator and two-cycle ratios add 0.25/0.5/0.75/1.5 turns
- the motion vocabulary is `pro` and `anti` at those turn values, nothing else
- both diamond and box grids are used (box mode puts initial arcs at 45/135/225)

**The 25 letters he never touches are the non-continuous vocabulary:** Type 2
(W X Y Z Σ Δ Θ Ω), Type 3 dashes, Type 4/5 (Φ Ψ Λ and dashes), Type 6 statics
(α β γ). A tether can only pull, so static and dash need a gripped prop. That
containment is the whole story: poi lives inside TKA as the dual-shift region.

A VTG cell is 2 frames = **one pictograph**. An Eight Step cell is 13 frames =
**a 12-step word**. His `column-row` reference is END-START — the row sets the
shared start frame, the column sets the continuation.

## Files

- `tka-transcription.json` — 3,312 patterns (1,584 transcribed at 1:1/1:3/1:5
  plus 1,728 derived for 1:2/1:4/2:3/2:5); per step: letter, start/end
  position, per-hand turns (`blueTurns`/`redTurns`), colour-swap flag.
- `cell-catalogue.json` — 288 rows, the canonical reading of each cell
  (diamond, non-anti, Qtr #1), with its TKA word and start position.
- `editor-v9-quarter-turn-club-loop.json`: the 24-step TKA transcription of
  the supplied SpiroAnim v9 editor artifact, including all 48 explicit
  interradial start/end orientations and 0.25-turn values.

## What he has that TKA does not

1. **Dual hands/props classification** — two codes per pattern (`6-3` = `SO/TS`)
   with a local-frame parity correction, because world-space rotation axes lie
   after a quarter-phase transform. TKA classifies one mode. TKA has the
   information; it has nowhere to put a cycle-level code, since its unit is a
   discrete step.
2. **Wall-plane feasibility** — 24 Eight Step cells marked difficult or
   impossible in wall plane (`EightStepPane.vue:262`). Rare *negative*,
   gravity-bound evidence. Feeds `project_wall_plane_feasibility`.
3. **A momentum-preserving reversal algorithm** — his `QTR Trans'` toggle
   inserts a beat before each relationship change and derives the handoff as
   `-turns - 2*arc`, reversing the local rotation axis while preserving compiled
   prop rotation. That is a worked solution to the reversal problem
   `poi-legality.md` §5 says we have no language for.
4. **Parallel-transport plane solving** — plane is relative to an orthogonal
   reference transported through every preceding frame, not a fixed CW/CCW
   lookup, which breaks when the capping hand reverses.
5. Speed ratio as a first-class axis (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 2:3, 2:5 bridge
   to TKA turns; 2:1 has no TKA reading).

## Two cautions for anything built on this

**It is positive evidence, not a legality boundary.** This is a curated
pedagogical corpus (Yee's book, Gage's pages), not an enumeration. It shows
these patterns are performed; absence from it is not a physics claim. The 24
wall-plane marks are the exception and are disproportionately valuable.

**Do not canonicalize by rotation.** `poi-legality.md` §4: TKA is rotation- and
reflection-invariant because gravity is irrelevant to it; poi notation is
gravity-bound and rotation is not a symmetry. VTG *rules* may be canonicalized;
Eight Step handpaths and the wall-plane marks must not be, or the gravity
information that makes this corpus worth having is destroyed.

## Reproducing

Clone spiroanim, `npm install`, add a vitest spec that imports the builders and
writes JSON, then resolve against the dataframes. The dump and resolver scripts
lived in a session scratchpad and are not vendored here; the method above is
sufficient to regenerate.
